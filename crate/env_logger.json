This is one of the more powerful methods in the standard\nlibrary, used in a variety of contexts.\n\nThe most basic pattern in which `collect()` is used is to turn one\ncollection into another. You take a collection, call [`iter`] on it,\ndo a bunch of transformations, and then `collect()` at the end.\n\n`collect()` can also create instances of types that are not typical\ncollections. For example, a [`String`] can be built from [`char`]s,\nand an iterator of [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`] items can be collected\ninto `Result<Collection<T>, E>`. See the examples below for more.\n\nBecause `collect()` is so general, it can cause problems with type\ninference. As such, `collect()` is one of the few times you'll see\nthe syntax affectionately known as the 'turbofish': `::<>`. This\nhelps the inference algorithm understand specifically which collection\nyou're trying to collect into.\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled: Vec<i32> = a.iter()\n                         .map(|&x| x * 2)\n                         .collect();\n\nassert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n```\n\nNote that we needed the `: Vec<i32>` on the left-hand side. This is because\nwe could collect into, for example, a [`VecDeque<T>`] instead:\n\n[`VecDeque<T>`]: ../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html\n\n```\nuse std::collections::VecDeque;\n\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled: VecDeque<i32> = a.iter().map(|&x| x * 2).collect();\n\nassert_eq!(2, doubled[0]);\nassert_eq!(4, doubled[1]);\nassert_eq!(6, doubled[2]);\n```\n\nUsing the 'turbofish' instead of annotating `doubled`:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<i32>>();\n\nassert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n```\n\nBecause `collect()` only cares about what you're collecting into, you can\nstill use a partial type hint, `_`, with the turbofish:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<_>>();\n\nassert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n```\n\nUsing `collect()` to make a [`String`]:\n\n```\nlet chars = ['g', 'd', 'k', 'k', 'n'];\n\nlet hello: String = chars.iter()\n    .map(|&x| x as u8)\n    .map(|x| (x + 1) as char)\n    .collect();\n\nassert_eq!(\"hello\", hello);\n```\n\nIf you have a list of [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`]s, you can use `collect()` to\nsee if any of them failed:\n\n```\nlet results = [Ok(1), Err(\"nope\"), Ok(3), Err(\"bad\")];\n\nlet result: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = results.iter().cloned().collect();\n\n// gives us the first error\nassert_eq!(Err(\"nope\"), result);\n\nlet results = [Ok(1), Ok(3)];\n\nlet result: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = results.iter().cloned().collect();\n\n// gives us the list of answers\nassert_eq!(Ok(vec![1, 3]), result);\n```\n\n[`iter`]: Iterator::next\n[`String`]: ../../std/string/struct.String.html\n[`char`]: type@char","links":{"`Result`":"2:47993:211","type@char":"1:15978:2726","Iterator::next":"2:8774:948"},"attrs":["#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]","#[must_use =\n\"if you really need to exhaust the iterator, consider `.for_each(drop)` instead\"]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}]],"output":{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"B","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"FromIterator","id":"2:8572:137","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"Item","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"trait":{"name":"Iterator","id":"2:8772:160","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}}],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"0:473:1801":{"id":"0:473:1801","crate_id":0,"name":"DEFAULT_FILTER_ENV","span":{"filename":"src/lib.rs","begin":[301,0],"end":[301,48]},"visibility":"public","docs":"The default name for the environment variable to read filters from.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"constant","inner":{"type":{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":"'static","mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"str"}}},"expr":"\"RUST_LOG\"","value":null,"is_literal":true}},"1:4437:3804":{"id":"1:4437:3804","crate_id":1,"name":"read","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Pull some bytes from this source into the specified buffer, returning\nhow many bytes were read.\n\nThis function does not provide any guarantees about whether it blocks\nwaiting for data, but if an object needs to block for a read and cannot,\nit will typically signal this via an [`Err`] return value.\n\nIf the return value of this method is [`Ok(n)`], then implementations must\nguarantee that `0 <= n <= buf.len()`.

transforms an iterator into a collection, short circuiting if\na failure is encountered.\n\n`try_collect()` is a variation of [`collect()`][`collect`] that allows fallible\nconversions during collection. Its main use case is simplifying conversions from\niterators yielding [`Option<T>`][`Option`] into `Option<Collection<T>>`, or similarly for other [`Try`]\ntypes (e.g. [`Result`]).\n\nImportantly, `try_collect()` doesn't require that the outer [`Try`] type also implements [`FromIterator`];\nonly the inner type produced on `Try::Output` must implement it. Concretely,\nthis means that collecting into `ControlFlow<_, Vec<i32>>` is valid because `Vec<i32>` implements\n[`FromIterator`], even though [`ControlFlow`] doesn't.\n\nAlso, if a failure is encountered during `try_collect()`, the iterator is still valid and\nmay continue to be used, in which case it will continue iterating starting after the element that\ntriggered the failure. See the last example below for an example of how this works.\n\n# Examples\nSuccessfully collecting an iterator of `Option<i32>` into `Option<Vec<i32>>`:\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nlet u = vec![Some(1), Some(2), Some(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Some(vec![1, 2, 3]));\n```\n\nFailing to collect in the same way:\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nlet u = vec![Some(1), Some(2), None, Some(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, None);\n```\n\nA similar example, but with `Result`:\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nlet u: Vec<Result<i32, ()>> = vec![Ok(1), Ok(2), Ok(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Ok(vec![1, 2, 3]));\n\nlet u = vec![Ok(1), Ok(2), Err(()), Ok(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Err(()));\n```\n\nFinally, even [`ControlFlow`] works, despite the fact that it\ndoesn't implement [`FromIterator`]. Note also that the iterator can\ncontinue to be used, even if a failure is encountered:\n\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nuse core::ops::ControlFlow::{Break, Continue};\n\nlet u = [Continue(1), Continue(2), Break(3), Continue(4), Continue(5)];\nlet mut it = u.into_iter();\n\nlet v = it.try_collect::<Vec<_>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Break(3));\n\nlet v =

Knowing that it's five\n// exactly wouldn't be possible without executing filter().\nassert_eq!((0, Some(10)), iter.size_hint());\n\n// Let's add five more numbers with chain()\nlet iter = (0..10).filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).chain(15..20);\n\n// now both bounds are increased by five\nassert_eq!((5, Some(15)), iter.size_hint());\n```\n\nReturning `None` for an upper bound:\n\n```\n// an infinite iterator has no upper bound\n// and the maximum possible lower bound\nlet iter = 0..;\n\nassert_eq!((usize::MAX, None), iter.size_hint());\n```","links":{"`usize`":"1:16001:2746","None":"2:47870:179","`None`":"2:47870:179","Option":"2:47868:181","usize":"1:16001:2746"},"attrs":["#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}]],"output":{"kind":"tuple","inner":[{"kind":"primitive","inner":"usize"},{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Option","id":"2:47868:181","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"usize"}}],"bindings":[]}}}}]},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"2:10450:110":{"id":"2:10450:110","crate_id":2,"name":"Debug","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"trait","inner":{"is_auto":false,"is_unsafe":false,"items":["2:10451:671"],"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"bounds":[],"implementations":[]}},"1:4526:2288":{"id":"1:4526:2288","crate_id":1,"name":"split","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Returns an iterator over the contents of this reader split on the byte\n`byte`.\n\nThe iterator returned from this function will return instances of\n<code>[io::Result]<[Vec]\\<u8>></code>.

The closure returns the value that\nthe accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n\nThe initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\ncall.\n\nAfter applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `fold()`\nreturns the accumulator.\n\nThis operation is sometimes called 'reduce' or 'inject'.\n\nFolding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want\nto produce a single value from it.\n\nNote: `fold()`, and similar methods that traverse the entire iterator,\nmight not terminate for infinite iterators, even on traits for which a\nresult is determinable in finite time.\n\nNote: [`reduce()`] can be used to use the first element as the initial\nvalue, if the accumulator type and item type is the same.\n\nNote: `fold()` combines elements in a *left-associative* fashion. For associative\noperators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative\noperators like `-` the order will affect the final result.\nFor a *right-associative* version of `fold()`, see [`DoubleEndedIterator::rfold()`].\n\n# Note to Implementors\n\nSeveral of the other (forward) methods have default implementations in\nterms of this one, so try to implement this explicitly if it can\ndo something better than the default `for` loop implementation.\n\nIn particular, try to have this call `fold()` on the internal parts\nfrom which this iterator is composed.\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// the sum of all of the elements of the array\nlet sum = a.iter().fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);\n\nassert_eq!(sum, 6);\n```\n\nLet's walk through each step of the iteration here:\n\n| element | acc | x | result |\n|---------|-----|---|--------|\n|         | 0   |   |        |\n| 1       | 0   | 1 | 1      |\n| 2       | 1   | 2 | 3      |\n| 3       | 3   | 3 | 6      |\n\nAnd so, our final result, `6`.\n\nThis example demonstrates the left-associative nature of `fold()`:\nit builds a string, starting with an initial value\nand continuing with each element from the front until the back:\n\n```\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet zero = \"0\".to_string();\n\nlet result = numbers.iter().fold(zero, |acc, &x| {\n    format!(\"({acc} + {x})\")\n});\n\nassert_eq!(result, \"(((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)\");\n```\nIt's common for people who haven't used iterators a lot to\nuse a `for` loop with a list of things to build up a result. Those\ncan be turned into `fold()`s:\n\n[`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n```\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet mut result = 0;\n\n// for loop:\nfor i in &numbers {\n    result = result + i;\n}\n\n// fold:\nlet result2 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);\n\n// they're the same\nassert_eq!(result, result2);\n```\n\n[`reduce()`]:

This primarily means that any modifications made to memory on\nbehalf of this closure will **not** be visible to the parent process.\nThis is often a very constrained environment where normal operations\nlike `malloc`, accessing environment variables through [`std::env`]\nor acquiring a mutex are not guaranteed to work (due to\nother threads perhaps still running when the `fork` was run).\n\nFor further details refer to the [POSIX fork() specification]\nand the equivalent documentation for any targeted\nplatform, especially the requirements around *async-signal-safety*.\n\nThis also means that all resources such as file descriptors and\nmemory-mapped regions got duplicated. It is your responsibility to make\nsure that the closure does not violate library invariants by making\ninvalid use of these duplicates.\n\nPanicking in the closure is safe only if all the format arguments for the\npanic message can be safely formatted; this is because although\n`Command` calls [`std::panic::always_abort`](crate::panic::always_abort)\nbefore calling the pre_exec hook, panic will still try to format the\npanic message.\n\nWhen this closure is run, aspects such as the stdio file descriptors and\nworking directory have successfully been changed, so output to these\nlocations might not appear where intended.\n\n[POSIX fork() specification]:\n    https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fork.html\n[`std::env`]:

iterator method that reduces the iterator's elements to a single,\nfinal value, starting from the back.\n\nThis is the reverse version of [`Iterator::fold()`]: it takes elements\nstarting from the

The closure returns the value that\nthe accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n\nThe initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\ncall.\n\nAfter applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `rfold()`\nreturns the accumulator.\n\nThis operation is sometimes called 'reduce' or 'inject'.\n\nFolding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want\nto produce a single value from it.\n\nNote: `rfold()` combines elements in a *right-associative* fashion. For associative\noperators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative\noperators like `-` the order will affect the final result.\nFor a

The\nvalue of this environment variable is a comma-separated list of *logging\ndirectives*. A logging directive is of the form:\n\n```text\nexample::log::target=level\n```\n\nThe log target is typically equal to the path of the module the message\nin question originated from, though it can be overriden.\n\nThe path is rooted in the name of the crate it was compiled for, so if\nyour program is in a file called, for example, `hello.rs`, the path would\nsimply be be `hello`.\n\nFurthermore, the log can be filtered using prefix-search based on the\nspecified log target. A value of, for example, `RUST_LOG=example`, would\nmatch all of the messages with targets:\n\n* `example`\n* `example::test`\n* `example::test::module::submodule`\n* `examples::and_more_examples`\n\nWhen providing the crate name or a module path, explicitly specifying the\nlog level is optional. If omitted, all logging for the item will be\nenabled.\n\nThe names of the log levels that may be specified correspond to the\nvariations of the [`log::Level`][level-enum] enum from the `log`\ncrate. They are:\n\n* `error`\n* `warn`\n* `info`\n* `debug`\n* `trace`\n\nThere is also a pseudo logging level, `off`, which may be specified to\ndisable all logging for a given module or for the entire application. As\nwith the logging levels, the letter case is not significant[^fn-off].\n\n[^fn-off]: Similar to the universe of log level names, the `off` pseudo\n   log level feature is also provided by the underlying `log` crate.\n\nThe letter case is not significant for the logging level names; e.g.,\n`debug`, `DEBUG`, and `dEbuG` all represent the same logging level. For\nconsistency, our convention is to use the lower case names. Where our docs\ndo use other forms, they do so in the context of specific examples, so you\nwon't be surprised if you see similar usage in the wild.\n\nAs the log level for a module is optional, the module to enable logging for\nis also optional. **If only a level is provided, then the global log\nlevel for all modules is set to this value.**\n\nSome examples of valid values of `RUST_LOG` are:\n\n* `hello` turns on all logging for the 'hello' module\n* `trace` turns on all logging for the application, regardless of its name\n* `TRACE` turns on all logging for the application, regardless of its name (same as previous)\n* `info` turns on all info logging\n* `INFO` turns on all info logging (same as previous)\n* `hello=debug` turns on debug logging for 'hello'\n* `hello=DEBUG` turns on debug logging for 'hello' (same as previous)\n* `hello,std::option` turns on hello, and std's option logging\n* `error,hello=warn` turn on global error logging and also warn for hello\n* `error,hello=off`  turn on global error logging, but turn off logging for hello\n* `off` turns off all logging for the application\n* `OFF` turns off all logging for the application (same as previous)\n\n## Filtering results\n\nA `RUST_LOG` directive may include a regex filter. The syntax is to append `/`\nfollowed by a regex. Each message is checked against the regex, and is only\nlogged if it matches. Note that the matching is done after formatting the\nlog string but before adding any logging meta-data. There is a single filter\nfor all modules.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* `hello/foo` turns on all logging for the 'hello' module where the log\n  message includes 'foo'.\n* `info/f.o` turns on all info logging where the log message includes 'foo',\n  'f1o', 'fao', etc.\n* `hello=debug/foo*foo` turns on debug logging for 'hello' where the log\n  message includes 'foofoo' or 'fofoo' or 'fooooooofoo', etc.\n* `error,hello=warn/[0-9]scopes` turn on global error logging and also\n  warn for hello. In both cases the log message must include a single digit\n  number followed by 'scopes'.\n\n## Capturing logs in tests\n\nRecords logged during `cargo test` will not be captured by the test harness by default.\nThe [`Builder::is_test`] method can be used in unit tests to ensure logs will be captured:\n\n```\n# #[macro_use] extern crate log;\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    fn init() {\n        let _ = env_logger::builder().is_test(true).try_init();\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn it_works() {\n        init();\n\n        info!(\"This record will be captured by `cargo test`\");\n\n        assert_eq!(2, 1 + 1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEnabling test capturing comes at the expense of color and other style support\nand may have performance implications.\n\n## Disabling colors\n\nColors and other styles can be configured with the `RUST_LOG_STYLE`\nenvironment variable. It accepts the following values:\n\n* `auto` (default) will attempt to print style characters, but don't force the issue.\nIf the console isn't available on Windows, or if TERM=dumb, for example, then don't print colors.\n* `always` will always print style characters even if they aren't supported by the terminal.\nThis includes emitting ANSI colors on Windows if the console API is unavailable.\n* `never` will never print style characters.\n\n## Tweaking the default format\n\nParts of the default format can be excluded from the log output using the [`Builder`].\nThe following example excludes the timestamp from the log output:\n\n```\nenv_logger::builder()\n    .format_timestamp(None)\n    .init();\n```\n\n### Stability of the default format\n\nThe default format won't optimise for long-term stability, and explicitly makes no\nguarantees about the stability of its output across major, minor or patch version\nbumps during `0.x`.\n\nIf you want to capture or interpret the output of `env_logger` programmatically\nthen you should use a custom format.\n\n### Using a custom format\n\nCustom formats can be provided as closures to the [`Builder`].\nThese closures take a [`Formatter`] and `log::Record` as arguments:\n\n```\nuse std::io::Write;\n\nenv_logger::builder()\n    .format(|buf, record| {\n        writeln!(buf, \"{}: {}\", record.level(), record.args())\n    })\n    .init();\n```\n\nSee the [`fmt`] module for more details about custom formats.\n\n## Specifying defaults for environment variables\n\n`env_logger` can read configuration from environment variables.\nIf these variables aren't present, the default value to use can be tweaked with the [`Env`] type.\nThe following example defaults to log `warn` and above if the `RUST_LOG` environment variable\nisn't set:\n\n```\nuse env_logger::Env;\n\nenv_logger::Builder::from_env(Env::default().default_filter_or(\"warn\")).init();\n```\n\n[gh-repo-examples]: https://github.com/env-logger-rs/env_logger/tree/main/examples\n[level-enum]: https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/enum.Level.html\n[log-crate-url]: https://docs.rs/log/\n[`Builder`]: struct.Builder.html\n[`Builder::is_test`]: struct.Builder.html#method.is_test\n[`Env`]: struct.Env.html\n[`fmt`]: fmt/index.html","links":{"`Formatter`":"0:392:135"},"attrs":["#![doc(html_logo_url =\n\"https://www.rust-lang.org/logos/rust-logo-128x128-blk-v2.png\",\nhtml_favicon_url = \"https://www.rust-lang.org/static/images/favicon.ico\")]","#![deny(missing_debug_implementations, missing_docs)]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"module","inner":{"is_crate":true,"items":["0:32:1794","0:108:671","0:473:1801","0:474:1804","0:720:1812","0:475:1829","0:734:1843","0:572:1992","0:573:2002","0:574:2058","0:577:2073","0:580:1871","0:581:1869","0:455"],"is_stripped":false}},"0:517:1895":{"id":"0:517:1895","crate_id":0,"name":"from_default_env","span":{"filename":"src/lib.rs","begin":[886,4],"end":[888,5]},"visibility":"public","docs":"Creates the logger from the environment using default variable names.\n\nThis method is a convenient way to call `from_env(Env::default())` without\nhaving to use the `Env` type explicitly.

a single `str` into this hasher.\n\nIf you're implementing [`Hash`], you generally do not need to call this,\nas the `impl Hash for str` does, so you should prefer that instead.\n\nThis includes the domain separator for prefix-freedom, so you should\n**not** call `Self::write_length_prefix` before calling this.\n\n# Note to Implementers\n\nThere are at least two reasonable default ways to implement this.\nWhich one will be the default is not yet decided, so for now\nyou probably want to override it specifically.\n\n## The general answer\n\nIt's always correct to implement this with a length prefix:\n\n```\n# #![feature(hasher_prefixfree_extras)]\n# struct Foo;\n# impl std::hash::Hasher for Foo {\n# fn finish(&self) -> u64 { unimplemented!() }\n# fn write(&mut self, _bytes: &[u8]) { unimplemented!() }\nfn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) {\n    self.write_length_prefix(s.len());\n    self.write(s.as_bytes());\n}\n# }\n```\n\nAnd, if your `Hasher` works in `usize` chunks, this is likely a very\nefficient way to do it, as anything more complicated may well end up\nslower than just running the round with the length.\n\n## If your `Hasher` works byte-wise\n\nOne nice thing about `str` being UTF-8 is that the `b'\\xFF'` byte\nnever happens.  That means that you can append that to the byte stream\nbeing hashed and maintain prefix-freedom:\n\n```\n# #![feature(hasher_prefixfree_extras)]\n# struct Foo;\n# impl std::hash::Hasher for Foo {\n# fn finish(&self) -> u64 { unimplemented!() }\n# fn write(&mut self, _bytes: &[u8]) { unimplemented!() }\nfn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) {\n    self.write(s.as_bytes());\n    self.write_u8(0xff);\n}\n# }\n```\n\nThis does require that your implementation not add extra padding, and\nthus generally requires that you maintain a buffer, running a round\nonly once that buffer is full (or `finish` is called).\n\nThat's because if `write` pads data out to a fixed chunk size, it's\nlikely that it does it in such a way that `\"a\"` and `\"a\\x00\"` would\nend up hashing the same sequence of things, introducing conflicts.","links":{"`Hash`":"2:10688:143"},"attrs":["#[unstable(feature = \"hasher_prefixfree_extras\", issue =

up' two iterators into a single iterator of pairs.\n\n`zip()` returns a new iterator that will iterate over two other\niterators, returning a tuple where the first element comes from the\nfirst iterator, and the second element comes from the second iterator.\n\nIn other words, it zips two iterators together, into a single one.\n\nIf either iterator returns [`None`], [`next`] from the zipped iterator\nwill return [`None`].\nIf the zipped iterator has no more elements to return then each further attempt to advance\nit will first try to advance the first iterator at most one time and if it still yielded an item\ntry to advance the second iterator at most one time.\n\nTo 'undo' the result of zipping up two iterators, see [`unzip`].\n\n[`unzip`]: Iterator::unzip\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a1 = [1, 2, 3];\nlet a2 = [4, 5, 6];\n\nlet mut iter = a1.iter().zip(a2.iter());\n\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&1, &4)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&2, &5)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&3, &6)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\nSince the argument to `zip()` uses [`IntoIterator`], we can pass\nanything that can be converted into an [`Iterator`], not just an\n[`Iterator`] itself. For example, slices (`&[T]`) implement\n[`IntoIterator`], and so can be passed to `zip()` directly:\n\n```\nlet s1 = &[1, 2, 3];\nlet s2 = &[4, 5, 6];\n\nlet mut iter = s1.iter().zip(s2);\n\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&1, &4)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&2, &5)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&3, &6)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\n`zip()` is often used to zip an infinite iterator to a finite one.\nThis works because the finite iterator will eventually return [`None`],\nending the zipper. Zipping with `(0..)` can look a lot like [`enumerate`]:\n\n```\nlet enumerate: Vec<_> = \"foo\".chars().enumerate().collect();\n\nlet zipper: Vec<_> = (0..).zip(\"foo\".chars()).collect();\n\nassert_eq!((0, 'f'), enumerate[0]);\nassert_eq!((0, 'f'), zipper[0]);\n\nassert_eq!((1, 'o'), enumerate[1]);\nassert_eq!((1, 'o'), zipper[1]);\n\nassert_eq!((2, 'o'), enumerate[2]);\nassert_eq!((2, 'o'), zipper[2]);\n```\n\nIf both iterators have roughly equivalent syntax, it may be more readable to use [`zip`]:\n\n```\nuse std::iter::zip;\n\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\nlet b = [2, 3, 4];\n\nlet mut zipped = zip(\n    a.into_iter().map(|x| x * 2).skip(1),\n    b.into_iter().map(|x| x * 2).skip(1),\n);\n\nassert_eq!(zipped.next(), Some((4, 6)));\nassert_eq!(zipped.next(), Some((6, 8)));\nassert_eq!(zipped.next(), None);\n```\n\ncompared to:\n\n```\n# let a = [1, 2, 3];\n# let b = [2,
