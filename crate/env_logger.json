The\nvalue of this environment variable is a comma-separated list of *logging\ndirectives*. A logging directive is of the form:\n\n```text\nexample::log::target=level\n```\n\nThe log target is typically equal to the path of the module the message\nin question originated from, though it can be overriden.\n\nThe path is rooted in the name of the crate it was compiled for, so if\nyour program is in a file called, for example, `hello.rs`, the path would\nsimply be be `hello`.\n\nFurthermore, the the log can be filtered using prefix-search based on the\nspecified log target. A value of, for example, `RUST_LOG=example`, would\nmatch all of the messages with targets:\n\n* `example`\n* `example::test`\n* `example::test::module::submodule`\n* `examples::and_more_examples`\n\nWhen providing the crate name or a module path, explicitly specifying the\nlog level is optional. If omitted, all logging for the item will be\nenabled.\n\nThe names of the log levels that may be specified correspond to the\nvariations of the [`log::Level`][level-enum] enum from the `log`\ncrate. They are:\n\n* `error`\n* `warn`\n* `info`\n* `debug`\n* `trace`\n\nThere is also a pseudo logging level, `off`, which may be specified to\ndisable all logging for a given module or for the entire application. As\nwith the logging levels, the letter case is not significant[^fn-off].\n\n[^fn-off]: Similar to the universe of log level names, the `off` pseudo\n   log level feature is also provided by the underlying `log` crate.\n\nThe letter case is not significant for the logging level names; e.g.,\n`debug`, `DEBUG`, and `dEbuG` all represent the same logging level. For\nconsistency, our convention is to use the lower case names. Where our docs\ndo use other forms, they do so in the context of specific examples, so you\nwon't be surprised if you see similar usage in the wild.\n\nAs the log level for a module is optional, the module to enable logging for\nis also optional. **If only a level is provided, then the global log\nlevel for all modules is set to this value.**\n\nSome examples of valid values of `RUST_LOG` are:\n\n* `hello` turns on all logging for the 'hello' module\n* `trace` turns on all logging for the application, regardless of its name\n* `TRACE` turns on all logging for the application, regardless of its name (same as previous)\n* `info` turns on all info logging\n* `INFO` turns on all info logging (same as previous)\n* `hello=debug` turns on debug logging for 'hello'\n* `hello=DEBUG` turns on debug logging for 'hello' (same as previous)\n* `hello,std::option` turns on hello, and std's option logging\n* `error,hello=warn` turn on global error logging and also warn for hello\n* `error,hello=off`  turn on global error logging, but turn off logging for hello\n* `off` turns off all logging for the application\n* `OFF` turns off all logging for the application (same as previous)\n\n## Filtering results\n\nA `RUST_LOG` directive may include a regex filter. The syntax is to append `/`\nfollowed by a regex. Each message is checked against the regex, and is only\nlogged if it matches. Note that the matching is done after formatting the\nlog string but before adding any logging meta-data. There is a single filter\nfor all modules.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* `hello/foo` turns on all logging for the 'hello' module where the log\n  message includes 'foo'.\n* `info/f.o` turns on all info logging where the log message includes 'foo',\n  'f1o', 'fao', etc.\n* `hello=debug/foo*foo` turns on debug logging for 'hello' where the log\n  message includes 'foofoo' or 'fofoo' or 'fooooooofoo', etc.\n* `error,hello=warn/[0-9]scopes` turn on global error logging and also\n  warn for hello. In both cases the log message must include a single digit\n  number followed by 'scopes'.\n\n## Capturing logs in tests\n\nRecords logged during `cargo test` will not be captured by the test harness by default.\nThe [`Builder::is_test`] method can be used in unit tests to ensure logs will be captured:\n\n```\n# #[macro_use] extern crate log;\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    fn init() {\n        let _ = env_logger::builder().is_test(true).try_init();\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn it_works() {\n        init();\n\n        info!(\"This record will be captured by `cargo test`\");\n\n        assert_eq!(2, 1 + 1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEnabling test capturing comes at the expense of color and other style support\nand may have performance implications.\n\n## Disabling colors\n\nColors and other styles can be configured with the `RUST_LOG_STYLE`\nenvironment variable. It accepts the following values:\n\n* `auto` (default) will attempt to print style characters, but don't force the issue.\nIf the console isn't available on Windows, or if TERM=dumb, for example, then don't print colors.\n* `always` will always print style characters even if they aren't supported by the terminal.\nThis includes emitting ANSI colors on Windows if the console API is unavailable.\n* `never` will never print style characters.\n\n## Tweaking the default format\n\nParts of the default format can be excluded from the log output using the [`Builder`].\nThe following example excludes the timestamp from the log output:\n\n```\nenv_logger::builder()\n    .format_timestamp(None)\n    .init();\n```\n\n### Stability of the default format\n\nThe default format won't optimise for long-term stability, and explicitly makes no\nguarantees about the stability of its output across major, minor or patch version\nbumps during `0.x`.\n\nIf you want to capture or interpret the output of `env_logger` programmatically\nthen you should use a custom format.\n\n### Using a custom format\n\nCustom formats can be provided as closures to the [`Builder`].\nThese closures take a [`Formatter`] and `log::Record` as arguments:\n\n```\nuse std::io::Write;\n\nenv_logger::builder()\n    .format(|buf, record| {\n        writeln!(buf, \"{}: {}\", record.level(), record.args())\n    })\n    .init();\n```\n\nSee the [`fmt`] module for more details about custom formats.\n\n## Specifying defaults for environment variables\n\n`env_logger` can read configuration from environment variables.\nIf these variables aren't present, the default value to use can be tweaked with the [`Env`] type.\nThe following example defaults to log `warn` and above if the `RUST_LOG` environment variable\nisn't set:\n\n```\nuse env_logger::Env;\n\nenv_logger::Builder::from_env(Env::default().default_filter_or(\"warn\")).init();\n```\n\n[gh-repo-examples]:

the closest `x` not exceeding `index` where `is_char_boundary(x)` is `true`.\n\nThis method can help you truncate a string so that it's still valid UTF-8, but doesn't\nexceed a given number of bytes. Note that this is done purely at the character level\nand can still visually split graphemes, even though the underlying characters aren't\nsplit. For example, the emoji 🧑‍🔬 (scientist) could be split so that the string only\nincludes 🧑 (person) instead.\n\n# Examples\n\n```\n#![feature(round_char_boundary)]\nlet s = \"❤️🧡💛💚💙💜\";\nassert_eq!(s.len(), 26);\nassert!(!s.is_char_boundary(13));\n\nlet closest = s.floor_char_boundary(13);\nassert_eq!(closest, 10);\nassert_eq!(&s[..closest],
