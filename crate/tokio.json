In this\nsection, we will take a brief tour of Tokio, summarizing the major APIs and\ntheir uses.\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to enable all features. Do this by\nenabling the `full` feature flag:\n\n```toml\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\n```\n\n### Authoring applications\n\nTokio is great for writing applications and most users in this case shouldn't\nworry too much about what features they should pick. If you're unsure, we suggest\ngoing with `full` to ensure that you don't run into any road blocks while you're\nbuilding your application.\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example shows the quickest way to get started with Tokio.\n\n```toml\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\n```\n\n### Authoring libraries\n\nAs a library author your goal should be to provide the lightest weight crate\nthat is based on Tokio. To achieve this you should ensure that you only enable\nthe features you need. This allows users to pick up your crate without having\nto enable unnecessary features.\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example shows how you may want to import features for a library that just\nneeds to `tokio::spawn` and use a `TcpStream`.\n\n```toml\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"rt\", \"net\"] }\n```\n\n## Working With Tasks\n\nAsynchronous programs in Rust are based around lightweight, non-blocking\nunits of execution called [_tasks_][tasks]. The [`tokio::task`] module provides\nimportant tools for working with tasks:\n\n* The [`spawn`] function and [`JoinHandle`] type, for scheduling a new task\n  on the Tokio runtime and awaiting the output of a spawned task, respectively,\n* Functions for [running blocking operations][blocking] in an asynchronous\n  task context.\n\nThe [`tokio::task`] module is present only when the \"rt\" feature flag\nis enabled.\n\n[tasks]: task/index.html#what-are-tasks\n[`tokio::task`]: crate::task\n[`spawn`]: crate::task::spawn()\n[`JoinHandle`]: crate::task::JoinHandle\n[blocking]: task/index.html#blocking-and-yielding\n\nThe [`tokio::sync`] module contains synchronization primitives to use when\nneeding to communicate or share data. These include:\n\n* channels ([`oneshot`], [`mpsc`], [`watch`], and [`broadcast`]), for sending values\n  between tasks,\n* a non-blocking [`Mutex`], for controlling access to a shared, mutable\n  value,\n* an asynchronous [`Barrier`] type, for multiple tasks to synchronize before\n  beginning a computation.\n\nThe `tokio::sync` module is present only when the \"sync\" feature flag is\nenabled.\n\n[`tokio::sync`]: crate::sync\n[`Mutex`]: crate::sync::Mutex\n[`Barrier`]: crate::sync::Barrier\n[`oneshot`]: crate::sync::oneshot\n[`mpsc`]: crate::sync::mpsc\n[`watch`]: crate::sync::watch\n[`broadcast`]: crate::sync::broadcast\n\nThe [`tokio::time`] module provides utilities for tracking time and\nscheduling work. This includes functions for setting [timeouts][timeout] for\ntasks, [sleeping][sleep] work to run in the future, or [repeating an operation at an\ninterval][interval].\n\nIn order to use `tokio::time`, the \"time\" feature flag must be enabled.\n\n[`tokio::time`]: crate::time\n[sleep]: crate::time::sleep()\n[interval]: crate::time::interval()\n[timeout]: crate::time::timeout()\n\nFinally, Tokio provides a _runtime_ for executing asynchronous tasks. Most\napplications can use the [`#[tokio::main]`][main] macro to run their code on the\nTokio runtime. However, this macro provides only basic configuration options. As\nan alternative, the [`tokio::runtime`] module provides more powerful APIs for configuring\nand managing runtimes. You should use that module if the `#[tokio::main]` macro doesn't\nprovide the functionality you need.\n\nUsing the runtime requires the \"rt\" or \"rt-multi-thread\" feature flags, to\nenable the current-thread [single-threaded scheduler][rt] and the [multi-thread\nscheduler][rt-multi-thread], respectively. See the [`runtime` module\ndocumentation][rt-features] for details. In addition, the \"macros\" feature\nflag enables the `#[tokio::main]` and `#[tokio::test]` attributes.\n\n[main]: attr.main.html\n[`tokio::runtime`]: crate::runtime\n[`Builder`]: crate::runtime::Builder\n[`Runtime`]: crate::runtime::Runtime\n[rt]: runtime/index.html#current-thread-scheduler\n[rt-multi-thread]: runtime/index.html#multi-thread-scheduler\n[rt-features]: runtime/index.html#runtime-scheduler\n\n## CPU-bound tasks and blocking code\n\nTokio is able to concurrently run many tasks on a few threads by repeatedly\nswapping the currently running task on each thread. However, this kind of\nswapping can only happen at `.await` points, so code that spends a long time\nwithout reaching an `.await` will prevent other tasks from running. To\ncombat this, Tokio provides two kinds of threads: Core threads and blocking threads.\n\nThe core threads are where all asynchronous code runs, and Tokio will by default\nspawn one for each CPU core. You can use the environment variable `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS`\nto override the default value.\n\nThe blocking threads are spawned on demand, can be used to run blocking code\nthat would otherwise block other tasks from running and are kept alive when\nnot used for a certain amount of time which can be configured with [`thread_keep_alive`].\nSince it is not possible for Tokio to swap out blocking tasks, like it\ncan do with asynchronous code, the upper limit on the number of blocking\nthreads is very large. These limits can be configured on the [`Builder`].\n\nTo spawn a blocking task, you should use the [`spawn_blocking`] function.\n\n[`Builder`]: crate::runtime::Builder\n[`spawn_blocking`]: crate::task::spawn_blocking()\n[`thread_keep_alive`]: crate::runtime::Builder::thread_keep_alive()\n\n```\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // This is running on a core thread.\n\n    let blocking_task = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(|| {\n        // This is running on a blocking thread.\n        // Blocking here is ok.\n    });\n\n    // We can wait for the blocking task like this:\n    // If the blocking task panics, the unwrap below will propagate the\n    // panic.\n    blocking_task.await.unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nIf your code is CPU-bound and you wish to limit the number of threads used\nto run it, you should use a separate thread pool dedicated to CPU bound tasks.\nFor example, you could consider using the [rayon] library for CPU-bound\ntasks. It is also possible to create an extra Tokio runtime dedicated to\nCPU-bound tasks, but if you do this, you should be careful that the extra\nruntime runs _only_ CPU-bound tasks, as IO-bound tasks on that runtime\nwill behave poorly.\n\nHint: If using rayon, you can use a [`oneshot`] channel to send the result back\nto Tokio when the rayon task finishes.\n\n[rayon]: https://docs.rs/rayon\n[`oneshot`]: crate::sync::oneshot\n\n## Asynchronous IO\n\nAs well as scheduling and running tasks, Tokio provides everything you need\nto perform input and output asynchronously.\n\nThe [`tokio::io`] module provides Tokio's asynchronous core I/O primitives,\nthe [`AsyncRead`], [`AsyncWrite`], and [`AsyncBufRead`] traits. In addition,\nwhen the \"io-util\" feature flag is enabled, it also provides combinators and\nfunctions for working with these traits, forming as an asynchronous\ncounterpart to [`std::io`].\n\nTokio also includes APIs for performing various kinds of I/O and interacting\nwith the operating system asynchronously. These include:\n\n* [`tokio::net`], which contains non-blocking versions of [TCP], [UDP], and\n  [Unix Domain Sockets][UDS] (enabled by the \"net\" feature flag),\n* [`tokio::fs`], similar to [`std::fs`] but for performing filesystem I/O\n  asynchronously (enabled by the \"fs\" feature flag),\n* [`tokio::signal`], for asynchronously handling Unix and Windows OS signals\n  (enabled by the \"signal\" feature flag),\n* [`tokio::process`], for spawning and managing child processes (enabled by\n  the \"process\" feature flag).\n\n[`tokio::io`]: crate::io\n[`AsyncRead`]: crate::io::AsyncRead\n[`AsyncWrite`]: crate::io::AsyncWrite\n[`AsyncBufRead`]: crate::io::AsyncBufRead\n[`std::io`]: std::io\n[`tokio::net`]: crate::net\n[TCP]: crate::net::tcp\n[UDP]: crate::net::UdpSocket\n[UDS]: crate::net::unix\n[`tokio::fs`]: crate::fs\n[`std::fs`]: std::fs\n[`tokio::signal`]: crate::signal\n[`tokio::process`]: crate::process\n\n# Examples\n\nA simple TCP echo server:\n\n```no_run\nuse tokio::net::TcpListener;\nuse tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\").await?;\n\n    loop {\n        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;\n\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            let mut buf = [0; 1024];\n\n            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.\n            loop {\n                let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {\n                    // socket closed\n                    Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,\n                    Ok(n) => n,\n                    Err(e) => {\n                        eprintln!(\"failed to read from socket; err = {:?}\", e);\n                        return;\n                    }\n                };\n\n                // Write the data back\n                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {\n                    eprintln!(\"failed to write to socket; err = {:?}\", e);\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nTokio uses a set of [feature flags] to reduce the amount of compiled code. It\nis possible to just enable certain features over others. By default, Tokio\ndoes not enable any features but allows one to enable a subset for their use\ncase. Below is a list of the available feature flags. You may also notice\nabove each function, struct and trait there is listed one or more feature flags\nthat are required for that item to be used. If you are new to Tokio it is\nrecommended that you use the `full` feature flag which will enable all public APIs.\nBeware though that this will pull in many extra dependencies that you may not\nneed.\n\n- `full`: Enables all features listed below except `test-util` and `tracing`.\n- `rt`: Enables `tokio::spawn`, the current-thread scheduler,\n        and non-scheduler utilities.\n- `rt-multi-thread`: Enables the heavier, multi-threaded, work-stealing scheduler.\n- `io-util`: Enables the IO based `Ext` traits.\n- `io-std`: Enable `Stdout`, `Stdin` and `Stderr` types.\n- `net`: Enables `tokio::net` types such as `TcpStream`, `UnixStream` and\n         `UdpSocket`, as well as (on Unix-like systems) `AsyncFd` and (on\n         FreeBSD) `PollAio`.\n- `time`: Enables `tokio::time` types and allows the schedulers to enable\n          the built in timer.\n- `process`: Enables `tokio::process` types.\n- `macros`: Enables `#[tokio::main]` and `#[tokio::test]` macros.\n- `sync`: Enables all `tokio::sync` types.\n- `signal`: Enables all `tokio::signal` types.\n- `fs`: Enables `tokio::fs` types.\n- `test-util`: Enables testing based infrastructure for the Tokio runtime.\n- `parking_lot`: As a potential optimization, use the `_parking_lot_` crate's\n                 synchronization primitives internally. Also, this\n                 dependency is necessary to construct some of our primitives\n                 in a `const` context. `MSRV` may increase according to the\n                 `_parking_lot_` release in use.\n\n_Note: `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits do not require any features and are\nalways available._\n\n### Unstable features\n\nSome feature flags are only available when specifying the `tokio_unstable` flag:\n\n- `tracing`: Enables tracing events.\n\nLikewise, some parts of the API are only available with the same flag:\n\n- [`task::Builder`]\n- Some methods on [`task::JoinSet`]\n- [`runtime::RuntimeMetrics`]\n- [`runtime::Builder::unhandled_panic`]\n- [`task::Id`]\n\nThis flag enables **unstable** features. The public API of these features\nmay break in 1.x releases. To enable these features, the `--cfg\ntokio_unstable` argument must be passed to `rustc` when compiling. This\nserves to explicitly opt-in to features which may break semver conventions,\nsince Cargo [does not yet directly support such opt-ins][unstable features].\n\nYou can specify it in your project's `.cargo/config.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n[build]\nrustflags = [\"--cfg\", \"tokio_unstable\"]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can specify it with an environment variable:\n\n```sh\n## Many *nix shells:\nexport RUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg tokio_unstable\"\ncargo build\n```\n\n```powershell\n## Windows PowerShell:\n$Env:RUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg tokio_unstable\"\ncargo build\n```\n\n[unstable features]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/feature-request-unstable-opt-in-non-transitive-crate-features/16193#why-not-a-crate-feature-2\n[feature flags]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-section\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nTokio currently guarantees support for the following platforms:\n\n * Linux\n * Windows\n * Android (API level 21)\n * macOS\n * iOS\n * FreeBSD\n\nTokio will continue to support these platforms in the future. However,\nfuture releases may change requirements such as the minimum required libc\nversion on Linux, the API level on Android, or the supported FreeBSD\nrelease.\n\nBeyond the above platforms, Tokio is intended to work on all platforms\nsupported by the mio crate. You can find a longer list [in mio's\ndocumentation][mio-supported]. However, these additional platforms may\nbecome unsupported in the future.\n\nNote that Wine is considered to be a different platform from Windows. See\nmio's documentation for more information on Wine support.\n\n[mio-supported]: https://crates.io/crates/mio#platforms\n\n### `WASM` support\n\nTokio has some limited support for the `WASM` platform. Without the\n`tokio_unstable` flag, the following features are supported:\n\n * `sync`\n * `macros`\n * `io-util`\n * `rt`\n * `time`\n\nEnabling any other feature (including `full`) will cause a compilation\nfailure.\n\nThe `time` module will only work on `WASM` platforms that have support for\ntimers (e.g. wasm32-wasi). The timing functions will panic if used on a `WASM`\nplatform that does not support timers.\n\nNote also that if the runtime becomes indefinitely idle, it will panic\nimmediately instead of blocking forever. On platforms that don't support\ntime, this means that the runtime can never be idle in any way.\n\n### Unstable `WASM` support\n\nTokio also has unstable support for some additional `WASM` features. This\nrequires the use of the `tokio_unstable` flag.\n\nUsing this flag enables the use of `tokio::net` on the wasm32-wasi target.\nHowever, not all methods are available on the networking types as `WASI`\ncurrently does not support the creation of new sockets from within `WASM`.\nBecause of this, sockets must currently be created via the `FromRawFd`\ntrait.","links":{"crate::io":"0:98:2124","crate::task":"0:507:2134","crate::io::AsyncBufRead":"0:107:2566","std::fs":"1:2242:2110","crate::sync":"0:781:1566","crate::runtime":"0:586:2128","std::io":"1:2496:2124","crate::io::AsyncRead":"0:135:2568","crate::io::AsyncWrite":"0:186:2572","crate::net":"0:276:2112"},"attrs":["#![allow(clippy::cognitive_complexity,

Primarily, it\ndefines two traits, [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`], which are asynchronous\nversions of the [`Read`] and [`Write`] traits in the standard library.\n\n# `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`\n\nLike the standard library's [`Read`] and [`Write`] traits, [`AsyncRead`] and\n[`AsyncWrite`] provide the most general interface for reading and writing\ninput and output. Unlike the standard library's traits, however, they are\n_asynchronous_ &mdash; meaning that reading from or writing to a `tokio::io`\ntype will _yield_ to the Tokio scheduler when IO is not ready, rather than\nblocking. This allows other tasks to run while waiting on IO.\n\nAnother difference is that `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` only contain\ncore methods needed to provide asynchronous reading and writing\nfunctionality. Instead, utility methods are defined in the [`AsyncReadExt`]\nand [`AsyncWriteExt`] extension traits. These traits are automatically\nimplemented for all values that implement `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`\nrespectively.\n\nEnd users will rarely interact directly with `AsyncRead` and\n`AsyncWrite`. Instead, they will use the async functions defined in the\nextension traits. Library authors are expected to implement `AsyncRead`\nand `AsyncWrite` in order to provide types that behave like byte streams.\n\nEven with these differences, Tokio's `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits\ncan be used in almost exactly the same manner as the standard library's\n`Read` and `Write`. Most types in the standard library that implement `Read`\nand `Write` have asynchronous equivalents in `tokio` that implement\n`AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`, such as [`File`] and [`TcpStream`].\n\nFor example, the standard library documentation introduces `Read` by\n[demonstrating][std_example] reading some bytes from a [`std::fs::File`]. We\ncan do the same with [`tokio::fs::File`][`File`]:\n\n```no_run\nuse tokio::io::{self, AsyncReadExt};\nuse tokio::fs::File;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n    let mut f = File::open(\"foo.txt\").await?;\n    let mut buffer = [0; 10];\n\n    // read up to 10 bytes\n    let n = f.read(&mut buffer).await?;\n\n    println!(\"The bytes: {:?}\", &buffer[..n]);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n[`File`]: crate::fs::File\n[`TcpStream`]: crate::net::TcpStream\n[`std::fs::File`]: std::fs::File\n[std_example]: std::io#read-and-write\n\n## Buffered Readers and Writers\n\nByte-based interfaces are unwieldy and can be inefficient, as we'd need to be\nmaking near-constant calls to the operating system. To help with this,\n`std::io` comes with [support for _buffered_ readers and writers][stdbuf],\nand therefore, `tokio::io` does as well.\n\nTokio provides an async version of the [`std::io::BufRead`] trait,\n[`AsyncBufRead`]; and async [`BufReader`] and [`BufWriter`] structs, which\nwrap readers and writers. These wrappers use a buffer, reducing the number\nof calls and providing nicer methods for accessing exactly what you want.\n\nFor example, [`BufReader`] works with the [`AsyncBufRead`] trait to add\nextra methods to any async reader:\n\n```no_run\nuse tokio::io::{self, BufReader, AsyncBufReadExt};\nuse tokio::fs::File;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n    let f = File::open(\"foo.txt\").await?;\n    let mut reader = BufReader::new(f);\n    let mut buffer = String::new();\n\n    // read a line into buffer\n    reader.read_line(&mut buffer).await?;\n\n    println!(\"{}\", buffer);\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n[`BufWriter`] doesn't add any new ways of writing; it just buffers every call\nto [`write`](crate::io::AsyncWriteExt::write). However, you **must** flush\n[`BufWriter`] to ensure that any buffered data is written.\n\n```no_run\nuse tokio::io::{self, BufWriter, AsyncWriteExt};\nuse tokio::fs::File;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> io::Result<()> {\n    let f = File::create(\"foo.txt\").await?;\n    {\n        let mut writer = BufWriter::new(f);\n\n        // Write a byte to the buffer.\n        writer.write(&[42u8]).await?;\n\n        // Flush the buffer before it goes out of scope.\n        writer.flush().await?;\n\n    } // Unless flushed or shut down, the contents of the buffer is discarded on drop.\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n[stdbuf]: std::io#bufreader-and-bufwriter\n[`std::io::BufRead`]: std::io::BufRead\n[`AsyncBufRead`]: crate::io::AsyncBufRead\n[`BufReader`]: crate::io::BufReader\n[`BufWriter`]: crate::io::BufWriter\n\n## Implementing `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`\n\nBecause they are traits, we can implement [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`] for\nour own types, as well. Note that these traits must only be implemented for\nnon-blocking I/O types that integrate with the futures type system. In\nother words, these types must never block the thread, and instead the\ncurrent task is notified when the I/O resource is ready.\n\n## Conversion to and from Stream/Sink\n\nIt is often convenient to encapsulate the reading and writing of bytes in a\n[`Stream`] or [`Sink`] of data.\n\nTokio provides simple wrappers for converting [`AsyncRead`] to [`Stream`]\nand vice-versa in the [tokio-util] crate, see [`ReaderStream`] and\n[`StreamReader`].\n\nThere are also utility traits that abstract the asynchronous buffering\nnecessary to write your own adaptors for encoding and decoding bytes to/from\nyour structured data, allowing to transform something that implements\n[`AsyncRead`]/[`AsyncWrite`] into a [`Stream`]/[`Sink`], see [`Decoder`] and\n[`Encoder`] in the [tokio-util::codec] module.\n\n[tokio-util]: https://docs.rs/tokio-util\n[tokio-util::codec]: https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/codec/index.html\n\n# Standard input and output\n\nTokio provides asynchronous APIs to standard [input], [output], and [error].\nThese APIs are very similar to the ones provided by `std`, but they also\nimplement [`AsyncRead`] and [`AsyncWrite`].\n\nNote that the standard input / output APIs  **must** be used from the\ncontext of the Tokio runtime, as they require Tokio-specific features to\nfunction. Calling these functions outside of a Tokio runtime will panic.\n\n[input]: fn@stdin\n[output]: fn@stdout\n[error]: fn@stderr\n\n# `std` re-exports\n\nAdditionally, [`Error`], [`ErrorKind`],

or attempts to shut down this writer, returning success when\nthe I/O connection has completely shut down.\n\nThis method is intended to be used for asynchronous shutdown of I/O\nconnections. For example this is suitable for implementing shutdown of a\nTLS connection or calling `TcpStream::shutdown` on a proxied connection.\nProtocols sometimes need to flush out final pieces of data or otherwise\nperform a graceful shutdown handshake, reading/writing more data as\nappropriate. This method is the hook for such protocols to implement the\ngraceful shutdown logic.\n\nThis `shutdown` method is required by implementers of the\n`AsyncWrite` trait. Wrappers typically just want to proxy this call\nthrough to the wrapped type, and base types will typically implement\nshutdown logic here or just return `Ok(().into())`. Note that if you're\nwrapping an underlying `AsyncWrite` a call to `shutdown` implies that\ntransitively the entire stream has been shut down. After your wrapper's\nshutdown logic has been executed you should shut down the underlying\nstream.\n\nInvocation of a `shutdown` implies an invocation of `flush`. Once this\nmethod returns `Ready` it implies that a flush successfully happened\nbefore the shutdown happened. That is, callers don't need to call\n`flush` before calling `shutdown`. They can rely that by calling\n`shutdown` any pending buffered data will be written out.\n\n# Return value\n\nThis function returns a `Poll<io::Result<()>>` classified as such:\n\n* `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))` - indicates that the connection was\n  successfully shut down and is now safe to deallocate/drop/close\n  resources associated with it. This method means that the current task\n  will no longer receive any notifications due to this method and the\n  I/O object itself is likely no longer usable.\n\n* `Poll::Pending` - indicates that shutdown is initiated but could\n  not complete just yet. This may mean that more I/O needs to happen to\n  continue this shutdown operation. The current task is scheduled to\n  receive a notification when it's otherwise ready to continue the\n  shutdown operation. When woken up this method should be called again.\n\n* `Poll::Ready(Err(e))` - indicates a fatal error has happened with shutdown,\n  indicating that the shutdown operation did not complete successfully.\n  This typically means that the I/O object is no longer usable.\n\n# Errors\n\nThis function can return normal I/O errors through `Err`, described\nabove. Additionally this method may also render the underlying\n`Write::write` method no longer usable (e.g. will return errors in the\nfuture).

A task is similar\nto an OS thread, but rather than being managed by the OS scheduler, they are\nmanaged by the [Tokio runtime][rt]. Another name for this general pattern is\n[green threads]. If you are familiar with [`Go's goroutines`], [`Kotlin's\ncoroutines`], or [`Erlang's processes`], you can think of Tokio's tasks as\nsomething similar.\n\nKey points about tasks include:\n\n* Tasks are **light weight**. Because tasks are scheduled by the Tokio\n  runtime rather than the operating system, creating new tasks or switching\n  between tasks does not require a context switch and has fairly low\n  overhead. Creating, running, and destroying large numbers of tasks is\n  quite cheap, especially compared to OS threads.\n\n* Tasks are scheduled **cooperatively**. Most operating systems implement\n  _preemptive multitasking_. This is a scheduling technique where the\n  operating system allows each thread to run for a period of time, and then\n  _preempts_ it, temporarily pausing that thread and switching to another.\n  Tasks, on the other hand, implement _cooperative multitasking_. In\n  cooperative multitasking, a task is allowed to run until it _yields_,\n  indicating to the Tokio runtime's scheduler that it cannot currently\n  continue executing. When a task yields, the Tokio runtime switches to\n  executing the next task.\n\n* Tasks are **non-blocking**. Typically, when an OS thread performs I/O or\n  must synchronize with another thread, it _blocks_, allowing the OS to\n  schedule another thread. When a task cannot continue executing, it must\n  yield instead, allowing the Tokio runtime to schedule another task. Tasks\n  should generally not perform system calls or other operations that could\n  block a thread, as this would prevent other tasks running on the same\n  thread from executing as well. Instead, this module provides APIs for\n  running blocking operations in an asynchronous context.\n\n[rt]: crate::runtime\n[green threads]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads\n[Go's goroutines]: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1\n[Kotlin's coroutines]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html\n[Erlang's processes]: http://erlang.org/doc/getting_started/conc_prog.html#processes\n\n## Working with Tasks\n\nThis module provides the following APIs for working with tasks:\n\n### Spawning\n\nPerhaps the most important function in this module is [`task::spawn`]. This\nfunction can be thought of as an async equivalent to the standard library's\n[`thread::spawn`][`std::thread::spawn`]. It takes an `async` block or other\n[future], and creates a new task to run that work concurrently:\n\n```\nuse tokio::task;\n\n# async fn doc() {\ntask::spawn(async {\n    // perform some work here...\n});\n# }\n```\n\nLike [`std::thread::spawn`], `task::spawn` returns a [`JoinHandle`] struct.\nA `JoinHandle` is itself a future which may be used to await the output of\nthe spawned task. For example:\n\n```\nuse tokio::task;\n\n# #[tokio::main] async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\nlet join = task::spawn(async {\n    // ...\n    \"hello world!\"\n});\n\n// ...\n\n// Await the result of the spawned task.\nlet result = join.await?;\nassert_eq!(result, \"hello world!\");\n# Ok(())\n# }\n```\n\nAgain, like `std::thread`'s [`JoinHandle` type][thread_join], if the spawned\ntask panics, awaiting its `JoinHandle` will return a [`JoinError`]. For\nexample:\n\n```\nuse tokio::task;\n\n# #[tokio::main] async fn main() {\nlet join = task::spawn(async {\n    panic!(\"something bad happened!\")\n});\n\n// The returned result indicates that the task failed.\nassert!(join.await.is_err());\n# }\n```\n\n`spawn`, `JoinHandle`, and `JoinError` are present when the \"rt\"\nfeature flag is enabled.\n\n[`task::spawn`]: crate::task::spawn()\n[future]: std::future::Future\n[`std::thread::spawn`]: std::thread::spawn\n[`JoinHandle`]: crate::task::JoinHandle\n[thread_join]: std::thread::JoinHandle\n[`JoinError`]: crate::task::JoinError\n\n#### Cancellation\n\nSpawned tasks may be cancelled using the [`JoinHandle::abort`] or\n[`AbortHandle::abort`] methods. When one of these methods are called, the\ntask is signalled to shut down next time it yields at an `.await` point. If\nthe task is already idle, then it will be shut down as soon as possible\nwithout running again before being shut down. Additionally, shutting down a\nTokio runtime (e.g. by returning from `#[tokio::main]`) immediately cancels\nall tasks on it.\n\nWhen tasks are shut down, it will stop running at whichever `.await` it has\nyielded at. All local variables are destroyed by running their destructor.\nOnce shutdown has completed, awaiting the [`JoinHandle`] will fail with a\n[cancelled error](crate::task::JoinError::is_cancelled).\n\nNote that aborting a task does not guarantee that it fails with a cancelled\nerror, since it may complete normally first. For example, if the task does\nnot yield to the runtime at any point between the call to `abort` and the\nend of the task, then the [`JoinHandle`] will instead report that the task\nexited normally.\n\nBe aware that calls to [`JoinHandle::abort`] just schedule the task for\ncancellation, and will return before the cancellation has completed. To wait\nfor cancellation to complete, wait for the task to finish by awaiting the\n[`JoinHandle`]. Similarly, the [`JoinHandle::is_finished`] method does not\nreturn `true` until the cancellation has finished.\n\nCalling [`JoinHandle::abort`] multiple times has the same effect as calling\nit once.\n\nTokio also provides an [`AbortHandle`], which is like the [`JoinHandle`],\nexcept that it does not provide a mechanism to wait for the task to finish.\nEach task can only have one [`JoinHandle`], but it can have more than one\n[`AbortHandle`].\n\n[`JoinHandle::abort`]: crate::task::JoinHandle::abort\n[`AbortHandle::abort`]: crate::task::AbortHandle::abort\n[`AbortHandle`]: crate::task::AbortHandle\n[`JoinHandle::is_finished`]: crate::task::JoinHandle::is_finished\n\n### Blocking and Yielding\n\nAs we discussed above, code running in asynchronous tasks should not perform\noperations that can block. A blocking operation performed in a task running\non a thread that is also running other tasks would block the entire thread,\npreventing other tasks from running.\n\nInstead, Tokio provides two APIs for running blocking operations in an\nasynchronous context: [`task::spawn_blocking`] and [`task::block_in_place`].\n\nBe aware that if you call a non-async method from async code, that non-async\nmethod is still inside the asynchronous context, so you should also avoid\nblocking operations there. This includes destructors of objects destroyed in\nasync code.\n\n#### `spawn_blocking`\n\nThe `task::spawn_blocking` function is similar to the `task::spawn` function\ndiscussed in the previous section, but rather than spawning an\n_non-blocking_ future on the Tokio runtime, it instead spawns a\n_blocking_ function on a dedicated thread pool for blocking tasks. For\nexample:\n\n```\nuse tokio::task;\n\n# async fn docs() {\ntask::spawn_blocking(|| {\n    // do some compute-heavy work or call synchronous code\n});\n# }\n```\n\nJust like `task::spawn`, `task::spawn_blocking` returns a `JoinHandle`\nwhich we can use to await the result of the blocking operation:\n\n```rust\n# use tokio::task;\n# async fn docs() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{\nlet join = task::spawn_blocking(|| {\n    // do some compute-heavy work or call synchronous code\n    \"blocking completed\"\n});\n\nlet result = join.await?;\nassert_eq!(result, \"blocking completed\");\n# Ok(())\n# }\n```\n\n#### `block_in_place`\n\nWhen using the [multi-threaded runtime][rt-multi-thread], the [`task::block_in_place`]\nfunction is also available. Like `task::spawn_blocking`, this function\nallows running a blocking operation from an asynchronous context. Unlike\n`spawn_blocking`, however, `block_in_place` works by transitioning the\n_current_ worker thread to a blocking thread, moving other tasks running on\nthat thread to another worker thread. This can improve performance by avoiding\ncontext switches.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nuse tokio::task;\n\n# async fn docs() {\nlet result = task::block_in_place(|| {\n    // do some compute-heavy work or call synchronous code\n    \"blocking completed\"\n});\n\nassert_eq!(result, \"blocking completed\");\n# }\n```\n\n#### `yield_now`\n\nIn addition, this module provides a [`task::yield_now`] async function\nthat is analogous to the standard library's [`thread::yield_now`]. Calling\nand `await`ing this function will cause the current task to yield to the\nTokio runtime's scheduler, allowing other tasks to be\nscheduled. Eventually, the yielding task will be polled again, allowing it\nto execute. For example:\n\n```rust\nuse tokio::task;\n\n# #[tokio::main] async fn main() {\nasync {\n    task::spawn(async {\n        // ...\n        println!(\"spawned task done!\")\n    });\n\n    // Yield, allowing the newly-spawned task to execute first.\n    task::yield_now().await;\n    println!(\"main task done!\");\n}\n# .await;\n# }\n```\n\n### Cooperative scheduling\n\nA single call to [`poll`] on a top-level task may potentially do a lot of\nwork before it returns `Poll::Pending`. If a task runs for a long period of\ntime without yielding back to the executor, it can starve other tasks\nwaiting on that executor to execute them, or drive underlying resources.\nSince Rust does not have a runtime, it is difficult to forcibly preempt a\nlong-running task. Instead, this module provides an opt-in mechanism for\nfutures to collaborate with the executor to avoid starvation.\n\nConsider a future like this one:\n\n```\n# use tokio_stream::{Stream, StreamExt};\nasync fn drop_all<I: Stream + Unpin>(mut input: I) {\n    while let Some(_) = input.next().await {}\n}\n```\n\nIt may look harmless, but consider what happens under heavy load if the\ninput stream is _always_ ready. If we spawn `drop_all`, the task will never\nyield, and will starve other tasks and resources on the same executor.\n\nTo account for this, Tokio has explicit yield points in a number of library\nfunctions, which force tasks to return to the executor periodically.\n\n\n#### unconstrained\n\nIf necessary, [`task::unconstrained`] lets you opt a future out of Tokio's cooperative\nscheduling. When a future is wrapped with `unconstrained`, it will never be forced to yield to\nTokio. For example:\n\n```\n# #[tokio::main]\n# async fn main() {\nuse tokio::{task, sync::mpsc};\n\nlet fut = async {\n    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::unbounded_channel();\n\n    for i in 0..1000 {\n        let _ = tx.send(());\n        // This will always be ready. If coop was in effect, this code would be forced to yield\n        // periodically. However, if left unconstrained, then this code will never yield.\n        rx.recv().await;\n    }\n};\n\ntask::unconstrained(fut).await;\n# }\n```\n\n[`task::spawn_blocking`]:
