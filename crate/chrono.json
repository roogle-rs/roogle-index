not ready yet\n- [`Poll::Ready(val)`] with the result `val` of this future if it\n  finished successfully.\n\nOnce a future has finished, clients should not `poll` it again.\n\nWhen a future is not ready yet, `poll` returns `Poll::Pending` and\nstores a clone of the [`Waker`] copied from the current [`Context`].\nThis [`Waker`] is then woken once the future can make progress.\nFor example, a future waiting for a socket to become\nreadable would call `.clone()` on the [`Waker`] and store it.\nWhen a signal arrives elsewhere indicating that the socket is readable,\n[`Waker::wake`] is called and the socket future's task is awoken.\nOnce a task has been woken up, it should attempt to `poll` the future\nagain, which may or may not produce a final value.\n\nNote that on multiple calls to `poll`, only the [`Waker`] from the\n[`Context`] passed to the most recent call should be scheduled to\nreceive a wakeup.\n\n# Runtime characteristics\n\nFutures alone are *inert*; they must be *actively* `poll`ed to make\nprogress, meaning that each time the current task is woken up, it should\nactively re-`poll` pending futures that it still has an interest in.\n\nThe `poll` function is not called repeatedly in a tight loop -- instead,\nit should only be called when the future indicates that it is ready to\nmake progress (by calling `wake()`). If you're familiar with the\n`poll(2)` or `select(2)` syscalls on Unix it's worth noting that futures\ntypically do *not* suffer the same problems of \"all wakeups must poll\nall events\"; they are more like `epoll(4)`.\n\nAn implementation of `poll` should strive to return quickly, and should\nnot block. Returning quickly prevents unnecessarily clogging up\nthreads or event loops. If it is known ahead of time that a call to\n`poll` may end up taking awhile, the work should be offloaded to a\nthread pool (or something similar) to ensure that `poll` can return\nquickly.\n\n# Panics\n\nOnce a future has completed (returned `Ready` from `poll`), calling its\n`poll` method again may panic, block forever, or cause other kinds of\nproblems; the `Future` trait places no requirements on the effects of\nsuch a call. However, as the `poll` method is not marked `unsafe`,\nRust's usual rules apply: calls must never cause undefined behavior\n(memory corruption, incorrect use of `unsafe` functions, or the like),\nregardless of the future's state.\n\n[`Poll::Ready(val)`]: Poll::Ready\n[`Waker`]: crate::task::Waker\n[`Waker::wake`]:

A nonzero `n` value indicates\nthat the buffer `buf` has been filled in with `n` bytes of data from this\nsource. If `n` is `0`, then it can indicate one of two scenarios:\n\n1. This reader has reached its \"end of file\" and will likely no longer\n   be able to produce bytes. Note that this does not mean that the\n   reader will *always* no longer be able to produce bytes. As an example,\n   on Linux, this method will call the `recv` syscall for a [`TcpStream`],\n   where returning zero indicates the connection was shut down correctly. While\n   for [`File`], it is possible to reach the end of file and get zero as result,\n   but if more data is appended to the file, future calls to `read` will return\n   more data.\n2. The buffer specified was 0 bytes in length.\n\nIt is not an error if the returned value `n` is smaller than the buffer size,\neven when the reader is not at the end of the stream yet.\nThis may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now\n(e. g. being close to end-of-file) or because read() was interrupted by a signal.\n\nAs this trait is safe to implement, callers cannot rely on `n <= buf.len()` for safety.\nExtra care needs to be taken when `unsafe` functions are used to access the read bytes.\nCallers have to ensure that no unchecked out-of-bounds accesses are possible even if\n`n > buf.len()`.\n\nNo guarantees are provided about the contents of `buf` when this\nfunction is called, so implementations cannot rely on any property of the\ncontents of `buf` being true. It is recommended that *implementations*\nonly write data to `buf` instead of reading its contents.\n\nCorrespondingly, however, *callers* of this method must not assume any guarantees\nabout how the implementation uses `buf`. The trait is safe to implement,\nso it is possible that the code that's supposed to write to the buffer might also read\nfrom it. It is your responsibility to make sure that `buf` is initialized\nbefore calling `read`. Calling `read` with an uninitialized `buf` (of the kind one\nobtains via [`MaybeUninit<T>`]) is not safe, and can lead to undefined behavior.\n\n[`MaybeUninit<T>`]: crate::mem::MaybeUninit\n\n# Errors\n\nIf this function encounters any form of I/O or other error, an error\nvariant will be returned. If an error is returned then it must be\nguaranteed that no bytes were read.\n\nAn error of the [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] kind is non-fatal and the read\noperation should be retried if there is nothing else to do.\n\n# Examples\n\n[`File`]s implement `Read`:\n\n[`Ok(n)`]: Ok\n[`File`]: crate::fs::File\n[`TcpStream`]: crate::net::TcpStream\n\n```no_run\nuse std::io;\nuse

The closure returns the value that\nthe accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n\nThe initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\ncall.\n\nAfter applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `fold()`\nreturns the accumulator.\n\nThis operation is sometimes called 'reduce' or 'inject'.\n\nFolding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want\nto produce a single value from it.\n\nNote: `fold()`, and similar methods that traverse the entire iterator,\nmight not terminate for infinite iterators, even on traits for which a\nresult is determinable in finite time.\n\nNote: [`reduce()`] can be used to use the first element as the initial\nvalue, if the accumulator type and item type is the same.\n\nNote: `fold()` combines elements in a *left-associative* fashion. For associative\noperators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative\noperators like `-` the order will affect the final result.\nFor a *right-associative* version of `fold()`, see [`DoubleEndedIterator::rfold()`].\n\n# Note to Implementors\n\nSeveral of the other (forward) methods have default implementations in\nterms of this one, so try to implement this explicitly if it can\ndo something better than the default `for` loop implementation.\n\nIn particular, try to have this call `fold()` on the internal parts\nfrom which this iterator is composed.\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// the sum of all of the elements of the array\nlet sum = a.iter().fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);\n\nassert_eq!(sum, 6);\n```\n\nLet's walk through each step of the iteration here:\n\n| element | acc | x | result |\n|---------|-----|---|--------|\n|         | 0   |   |        |\n| 1       | 0   | 1 | 1      |\n| 2       | 1   | 2 | 3      |\n| 3       | 3   | 3 | 6      |\n\nAnd so, our final result, `6`.\n\nThis example demonstrates the left-associative nature of `fold()`:\nit builds a string, starting with an initial value\nand continuing with each element from the front until the back:\n\n```\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet zero = \"0\".to_string();\n\nlet result = numbers.iter().fold(zero, |acc, &x| {\n    format!(\"({acc} + {x})\")\n});\n\nassert_eq!(result, \"(((((0 + 1) + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)\");\n```\nIt's common for people who haven't used iterators a lot to\nuse a `for` loop with a list of things to build up a result. Those\ncan be turned into `fold()`s:\n\n[`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n```\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nlet mut result = 0;\n\n// for loop:\nfor i in &numbers {\n    result = result + i;\n}\n\n// fold:\nlet result2 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);\n\n// they're the same\nassert_eq!(result, result2);\n```\n\n[`reduce()`]: Iterator::reduce","links":{"Iterator::reduce":"2:9005:8035","`DoubleEndedIterator::rfold()`":"2:8758:8004"},"attrs":["#[doc(alias = \"inject\", alias = \"foldl\")]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}],["init",{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"}],["f",{"kind":"generic","inner":"F"}]],"output":{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"B","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}},{"name":"F","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}},{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"F"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"FnMut","id":"2:3697:132","args":{"parenthesized":{"inputs":[{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"},{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"Item","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"trait":{"name":"Iterator","id":"2:8905:160","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}],"output":{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"}}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"0:1294:2231":{"id":"0:1294:2231","crate_id":0,"name":"day","span":{"filename":"src/naive/date.rs","begin":[1308,4],"end":[1310,5]},"visibility":"default","docs":"Returns the day of month starting from 1.\n\nThe return value ranges from 1 to 31.

If a closure returns `Err` then no further closures\nwill be called and the spawn operation will immediately return with a\nfailure.\n\n# Notes and Safety\n\nThis closure will be run in the context of the child process after a\n`fork`. This primarily means that any modifications made to memory on\nbehalf of this closure will **not** be visible to the parent process.\nThis is often a very constrained environment where normal operations\nlike `malloc`, accessing environment variables through [`std::env`]\nor acquiring a mutex are not guaranteed to work (due to\nother threads perhaps still running when the `fork` was run).\n\nFor further details refer to the [POSIX fork() specification]\nand the equivalent documentation for any targeted\nplatform, especially the requirements around *async-signal-safety*.\n\nThis also means that all resources such as file descriptors and\nmemory-mapped regions got duplicated. It is your responsibility to make\nsure that the closure does not violate library invariants by making\ninvalid use of these duplicates.\n\nPanicking in the closure is safe only if all the format arguments for the\npanic message can be safely formatted; this is because although\n`Command` calls [`std::panic::always_abort`](crate::panic::always_abort)\nbefore calling the pre_exec hook, panic will still try to format the\npanic message.\n\nWhen this closure is run, aspects such as the stdio file descriptors and\nworking directory have successfully been changed, so output to these\nlocations might not appear where intended.\n\n[POSIX fork() specification]:\n    https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fork.html\n[`std::env`]:

leap second information.\n\nChrono does not try to accurately implement leap seconds; it is impossible.\nRather, **it allows for leap seconds but behaves as if there are *no other* leap seconds.**\nVarious operations will ignore any possible leap second(s)\nexcept when any of the operands were actually leap seconds.\n\nIf you cannot tolerate this behavior,\nyou must use a separate `TimeZone` for the International Atomic Time (TAI).\nTAI is like UTC but has no leap seconds, and thus slightly differs from UTC.\nChrono does not yet provide such implementation, but it is planned.\n\n## Representing Leap Seconds\n\nThe leap second is indicated via fractional seconds more than 1 second.\nThis makes possible to treat a leap second as the prior non-leap second\nif you don't care about sub-second accuracy.\nYou should use the proper formatting to get the raw leap second.\n\nAll methods accepting fractional seconds will accept such values.\n\n```\nuse chrono::{NaiveDate, NaiveTime, Utc, TimeZone};\n\nlet t = NaiveTime::from_hms_milli_opt(8, 59, 59, 1_000).unwrap();\n\nlet dt1 = NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2015, 7, 1).unwrap().and_hms_micro_opt(8, 59, 59, 1_000_000).unwrap();\n\nlet dt2 = NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2015, 6, 30).unwrap().and_hms_nano_opt(23, 59, 59, 1_000_000_000).unwrap().and_local_timezone(Utc).unwrap();\n# let _ = (t, dt1, dt2);\n```\n\nNote that the leap second can happen anytime given an appropriate time zone;\n2015-07-01 01:23:60 would be a proper leap second if UTC+01:24 had existed.\nPractically speaking, though, by the time of the first leap second on 1972-06-30,\nevery time zone offset around the world has standardized to the 5-minute alignment.\n\n## Date And Time Arithmetics\n\nAs a concrete example, let's assume that `03:00:60` and `04:00:60` are leap seconds.\nIn reality, of course, leap seconds are separated by at least 6 months.\nWe will also use some intuitive concise notations for the explanation.\n\n`Time + Duration`\n(short for [`NaiveTime::overflowing_add_signed`](#method.overflowing_add_signed)):\n\n- `03:00:00 + 1s = 03:00:01`.\n- `03:00:59 + 60s = 03:02:00`.\n- `03:00:59 + 1s = 03:01:00`.\n- `03:00:60 + 1s = 03:01:00`.\n  Note that the sum is identical to the previous.\n- `03:00:60 + 60s = 03:01:59`.\n- `03:00:60 + 61s = 03:02:00`.\n- `03:00:60.1 + 0.8s = 03:00:60.9`.\n\n`Time - Duration`\n(short for [`NaiveTime::overflowing_sub_signed`](#method.overflowing_sub_signed)):\n\n- `03:00:00 - 1s = 02:59:59`.\n- `03:01:00 - 1s = 03:00:59`.\n- `03:01:00 - 60s = 03:00:00`.\n- `03:00:60 - 60s = 03:00:00`.\n  Note that the result is identical to the previous.\n- `03:00:60.7 - 0.4s = 03:00:60.3`.\n- `03:00:60.7 - 0.9s = 03:00:59.8`.\n\n`Time - Time`\n(short for [`NaiveTime::signed_duration_since`](#method.signed_duration_since)):\n\n- `04:00:00 - 03:00:00 = 3600s`.\n- `03:01:00 - 03:00:00 = 60s`.\n- `03:00:60 - 03:00:00 = 60s`.\n  Note that the difference is identical to the previous.\n- `03:00:60.6 - 03:00:59.4 = 1.2s`.\n- `03:01:00 - 03:00:59.8 = 0.2s`.\n- `03:01:00 - 03:00:60.5 = 0.5s`.\n  Note that the difference is larger than the previous,\n  even though the leap second clearly follows the previous whole second.\n- `04:00:60.9 - 03:00:60.1 =\n  (04:00:60.9 - 04:00:00) + (04:00:00 - 03:01:00) + (03:01:00 - 03:00:60.1) =\n  60.9s + 3540s + 0.9s = 3601.8s`.\n\nIn general,\n\n- `Time + Duration` unconditionally equals to `Duration + Time`.\n\n- `Time - Duration` unconditionally equals to `Time + (-Duration)`.\n\n- `Time1 - Time2` unconditionally equals to `-(Time2 - Time1)`.\n\n- Associativity does not generally hold, because\n  `(Time + Duration1) - Duration2` no longer equals to `Time + (Duration1 - Duration2)`\n  for two positive durations.\n\n    - As a special case, `(Time + Duration) - Duration` also does not equal to `Time`.\n\n    - If you can assume that all durations have the same sign, however,\n      then the associativity holds:\n      `(Time + Duration1) + Duration2` equals to `Time + (Duration1 + Duration2)`\n      for two positive durations.\n\n## Reading And Writing Leap Seconds\n\nThe \"typical\" leap seconds on the minute boundary are\ncorrectly handled both in the formatting and parsing.\nThe leap second in the human-readable representation\nwill be represented as the second part being 60, as required by ISO 8601.\n\n```\nuse chrono::{Utc, TimeZone, NaiveDate};\n\nlet dt = NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2015, 6, 30).unwrap().and_hms_milli_opt(23, 59, 59, 1_000).unwrap().and_local_timezone(Utc).unwrap();\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{:?}\", dt), \"2015-06-30T23:59:60Z\");\n```\n\nThere are hypothetical leap seconds not on the minute boundary\nnevertheless supported by Chrono.\nThey are allowed for the sake of completeness and consistency;\nthere were several \"exotic\" time zone offsets with fractional minutes prior to UTC after all.\nFor such cases the human-readable representation is ambiguous\nand would be read back to the next non-leap second.\n\n```\nuse chrono::{DateTime, Utc, TimeZone, NaiveDate};\n\nlet dt = NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2015, 6, 30).unwrap().and_hms_milli_opt(23, 56, 4, 1_000).unwrap().and_local_timezone(Utc).unwrap();\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{:?}\", dt), \"2015-06-30T23:56:05Z\");\n\nlet dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2015, 6, 30, 23, 56, 5).unwrap();\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{:?}\", dt), \"2015-06-30T23:56:05Z\");\nassert_eq!(DateTime::parse_from_rfc3339(\"2015-06-30T23:56:05Z\").unwrap(), dt);\n```\n\nSince Chrono alone cannot determine any existence of leap seconds,\n**there is absolutely no guarantee that the leap second read has actually happened**.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"struct","inner":{"kind":{"plain":{"fields":[],"fields_stripped":true}},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"impls":["0:1750","a:2:3431:228-0:3225:1929","a:2:3417:220-0:3225:1929","a:2:9554:7695-0:3225:1929","a:2:9555:7694-0:3225:1929","a:2:3481:7604-0:3225:1929","b:2:4221-0:3225:1929","b:2:3260-0:3225:1929","b:2:2906-0:3225:1929","b:2:2903-0:3225:1929","b:2:3265-0:3225:1929","b:2:3254-0:3225:1929","b:2:3250-0:3225:1929","b:5:6512-0:3225:1929","b:5:859-0:3225:1929","0:3228","0:3229","0:3231","0:3232","0:3234","0:3237","0:3239","0:3241","0:3242","0:1779","0:1789","0:1792","0:1794","0:1797","0:1799","0:1802","0:1807","0:1809","0:1813","0:1968","0:1971"]}},"a:2:3481:7604-0:3720:1954":{"id":"a:2:3481:7604-0:3720:1954","crate_id":0,"name":null,"span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"impl","inner":{"is_unsafe":false,"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"provided_trait_methods":[],"trait":{"name":"Unpin","id":"2:3481:7604","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"for":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"ParseMonthError","id":"0:3720:1954","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}},"items":[],"negative":false,"synthetic":true,"blanket_impl":null}},"0:1532:2539":{"id":"0:1532:2539","crate_id":0,"name":"nanosecond","span":{"filename":"src/naive/datetime/mod.rs","begin":[1237,4],"end":[1239,5]},"visibility":"default","docs":"Returns

Its main use case is simplifying conversions from\niterators yielding [`Option<T>`][`Option`] into `Option<Collection<T>>`, or similarly for other [`Try`]\ntypes (e.g. [`Result`]).\n\nImportantly, `try_collect()` doesn't require that the outer [`Try`] type also implements [`FromIterator`];\nonly the inner type produced on `Try::Output` must implement it. Concretely,\nthis means that collecting into `ControlFlow<_, Vec<i32>>` is valid because `Vec<i32>` implements\n[`FromIterator`], even though [`ControlFlow`] doesn't.\n\nAlso, if a failure is encountered during `try_collect()`, the iterator is still valid and\nmay continue to be used, in which case it will continue iterating starting after the element that\ntriggered the failure. See the last example below for an example of how this works.\n\n# Examples\nSuccessfully collecting an iterator of `Option<i32>` into `Option<Vec<i32>>`:\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nlet u = vec![Some(1), Some(2), Some(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Some(vec![1, 2, 3]));\n```\n\nFailing to collect in the same way:\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nlet u = vec![Some(1), Some(2), None, Some(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, None);\n```\n\nA similar example, but with `Result`:\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nlet u: Vec<Result<i32, ()>> = vec![Ok(1), Ok(2), Ok(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Ok(vec![1, 2, 3]));\n\nlet u = vec![Ok(1), Ok(2), Err(()), Ok(3)];\nlet v = u.into_iter().try_collect::<Vec<i32>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Err(()));\n```\n\nFinally, even [`ControlFlow`] works, despite the fact that it\ndoesn't implement [`FromIterator`]. Note also that the iterator can\ncontinue to be used, even if a failure is encountered:\n\n```\n#![feature(iterator_try_collect)]\n\nuse core::ops::ControlFlow::{Break, Continue};\n\nlet u = [Continue(1), Continue(2), Break(3), Continue(4), Continue(5)];\nlet mut it = u.into_iter();\n\nlet v = it.try_collect::<Vec<_>>();\nassert_eq!(v, Break(3));\n\nlet v =

up' two iterators into a single iterator of pairs.\n\n`zip()` returns a new iterator that will iterate over two other\niterators, returning a tuple where the first element comes from the\nfirst iterator, and the second element comes from the second iterator.\n\nIn other words, it zips two iterators together, into a single one.\n\nIf either iterator returns [`None`], [`next`] from the zipped iterator\nwill return [`None`].\nIf the zipped iterator has no more elements to return then each further attempt to advance\nit will first try to advance the first iterator at most one time and if it still yielded an item\ntry to advance the second iterator at most one time.\n\nTo 'undo' the result of zipping up two iterators, see [`unzip`].\n\n[`unzip`]: Iterator::unzip\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a1 = [1, 2, 3];\nlet a2 = [4, 5, 6];\n\nlet mut iter = a1.iter().zip(a2.iter());\n\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&1, &4)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&2, &5)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&3, &6)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\nSince the argument to `zip()` uses [`IntoIterator`], we can pass\nanything that can be converted into an [`Iterator`], not just an\n[`Iterator`] itself. For example, slices (`&[T]`) implement\n[`IntoIterator`], and so can be passed to `zip()` directly:\n\n```\nlet s1 = &[1, 2, 3];\nlet s2 = &[4, 5, 6];\n\nlet mut iter = s1.iter().zip(s2);\n\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&1, &4)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&2, &5)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some((&3, &6)));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\n`zip()` is often used to zip an infinite iterator to a finite one.\nThis works because the finite iterator will eventually return [`None`],\nending the zipper. Zipping with `(0..)` can look a lot like [`enumerate`]:\n\n```\nlet enumerate: Vec<_> = \"foo\".chars().enumerate().collect();\n\nlet zipper: Vec<_> = (0..).zip(\"foo\".chars()).collect();\n\nassert_eq!((0, 'f'), enumerate[0]);\nassert_eq!((0, 'f'), zipper[0]);\n\nassert_eq!((1, 'o'), enumerate[1]);\nassert_eq!((1, 'o'), zipper[1]);\n\nassert_eq!((2, 'o'), enumerate[2]);\nassert_eq!((2, 'o'), zipper[2]);\n```\n\nIf both iterators have roughly equivalent syntax, it may be more readable to use [`zip`]:\n\n```\nuse std::iter::zip;\n\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\nlet b = [2, 3, 4];\n\nlet mut zipped = zip(\n    a.into_iter().map(|x| x * 2).skip(1),\n    b.into_iter().map(|x| x * 2).skip(1),\n);\n\nassert_eq!(zipped.next(), Some((4, 6)));\nassert_eq!(zipped.next(), Some((6, 8)));\nassert_eq!(zipped.next(), None);\n```\n\ncompared to:\n\n```\n# let a = [1, 2, 3];\n# let b = [2, 3, 4];\n#\nlet mut zipped = a\n    .into_iter()\n    .map(|x| x * 2)\n    .skip(1)\n    .zip(b.into_iter().map(|x| x * 2).skip(1));\n#\n# assert_eq!(zipped.next(), Some((4, 6)));\n# assert_eq!(zipped.next(), Some((6, 8)));\n# assert_eq!(zipped.next(), None);\n```\n\n[`enumerate`]: Iterator::enumerate\n[`next`]: Iterator::next\n[`zip`]: crate::iter::zip","links":{"Iterator::enumerate":"2:8940:3571","`IntoIterator`":"2:8709:153","Iterator::next":"2:8907:952","`None`":"2:51244:179","Iterator::unzip":"2:9083:8040","crate::iter::zip":"2:7994:6353","`Iterator`":"2:8905:160"},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}],["other",{"kind":"generic","inner":"U"}]],"output":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Zip","id":"2:50522:8533","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}},{"type":{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"IntoIter","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"U"},"trait":{"name":"IntoIterator","id":"2:8709:153","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}}],"bindings":[]}}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"U","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}},{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"U"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"IntoIterator","id":"2:8709:153","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"22:111:2909":{"id":"22:111:2909","crate_id":22,"name":"mod_floor","span":{"filename":"/home/runner/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/num-integer-0.1.45/src/lib.rs","begin":[78,4],"end":[78,46]},"visibility":"default","docs":"Floored integer modulo, satisfying:\n\n~~~\n# use num_integer::Integer;\n# let n = 1; let d = 1;\nassert!(n.div_floor(&d) * d + n.mod_floor(&d) == n)\n~~~\n\n# Examples\n\n~~~\n# use num_integer::Integer;\nassert!(( 8).mod_floor(& 3) ==  2);\nassert!(( 8).mod_floor(&-3) == -1);\nassert!((-8).mod_floor(& 3) ==  1);\nassert!((-8).mod_floor(&-3) == -2);\n\nassert!(( 1).mod_floor(& 2) ==  1);\nassert!(( 1).mod_floor(&-2) == -1);\nassert!((-1).mod_floor(& 2) ==  1);\nassert!((-1).mod_floor(&-2) == -1);\n~~~","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}],["other",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}]],"output":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":false}},"2:10845:666":{"id":"2:10845:666","crate_id":2,"name":"finish","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Returns the hash value for the values written so far.\n\nDespite its name, the method does not reset the hasher’s internal\nstate.

week date.\n\n# Calendar Date\n\nThe ISO 8601 **calendar date** follows the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\nIt is like a normal civil calendar but note some slight differences:\n\n* Dates before the Gregorian calendar's inception in 1582 are defined via the extrapolation.\n  Be careful, as historical dates are often noted in the Julian calendar and others\n  and the transition to Gregorian may differ across countries (as late as early 20C).\n\n  (Some example: Both Shakespeare from Britain and Cervantes from Spain seemingly died\n  on the same calendar date---April 23, 1616---but in the different calendar.\n  Britain used the Julian calendar at that time, so Shakespeare's death is later.)\n\n* ISO 8601 calendars has the year 0, which is 1 BCE (a year before 1 CE).\n  If you need a typical BCE/BC and CE/AD notation for year numbers,\n  use the [`Datelike::year_ce`](../trait.Datelike.html#method.year_ce) method.\n\n# Week Date\n\nThe ISO 8601 **week date** is a triple of year number, week number\nand [day of the week](../enum.Weekday.html) with the following rules:\n\n* A week consists of Monday through Sunday, and is always numbered within some year.\n  The week number ranges from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the year.\n\n* The week 1 of given year is defined as the first week containing January 4 of that year,\n  or equivalently, the first week containing four or more days in that year.\n\n* The year number in the week date may *not* correspond to the actual Gregorian year.\n  For example, January 3, 2016 (Sunday) was on the last (53rd) week of 2015.\n\nChrono's date types default to the ISO 8601 [calendar date](#calendar-date),\nbut [`Datelike::iso_week`](../trait.Datelike.html#tymethod.iso_week) and\n[`Datelike::weekday`](../trait.Datelike.html#tymethod.weekday) methods\ncan be used to get the corresponding week date.\n\n# Ordinal Date\n\nThe ISO 8601 **ordinal date** is a pair of year number and day of the year (\"ordinal\").\nThe ordinal number ranges from 1 to 365 or 366 depending on the year.\nThe year number is the same as that of the [calendar date](#calendar-date).\n\nThis is currently the internal format of Chrono's date types.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"struct","inner":{"kind":{"plain":{"fields":[],"fields_stripped":true}},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"impls":["0:1230","a:2:3431:228-0:3099:1927","a:2:3417:220-0:3099:1927","a:2:9554:7695-0:3099:1927","a:2:9555:7694-0:3099:1927","a:2:3481:7604-0:3099:1927","b:2:4221-0:3099:1927","b:2:3260-0:3099:1927","b:2:2906-0:3099:1927","b:2:2903-0:3099:1927","b:2:3265-0:3099:1927","b:2:3254-0:3099:1927","b:2:3250-0:3099:1927","b:5:6512-0:3099:1927","b:5:859-0:3099:1927","0:3101","0:3102","0:3104","0:3105","0:3107","0:3110","0:3112","0:3114","0:3115","0:1290","0:1307","0:1310","0:1312","0:1315","0:1318","0:1321","0:1324","0:1327","0:1329","0:1346","0:1351","0:1353","0:1357"]}},"0:3072":{"id":"0:3072","crate_id":0,"name":null,"span":{"filename":"src/format/mod.rs","begin":[867,9],"end":[867,14]},"visibility":{"restricted":{"parent":"0:589:685","path":"::format"}},"docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":["#[automatically_derived]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"impl","inner":{"is_unsafe":false,"generics":{"params":[{"name":"I","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"$crate::fmt::Debug","id":"2:10583:110","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[]},"provided_trait_methods":[],"trait":{"name":"Debug","id":"2:10583:110","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"for":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"DelayedFormat","id":"0:3066:2080","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"I"}}],"bindings":[]}}}},"items":["0:3074:674"],"negative":false,"synthetic":false,"blanket_impl":null}},"b:2:2903-0:2713:1920":{"id":"b:2:2903-0:2713:1920","crate_id":0,"name":null,"span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"impl","inner":{"is_unsafe":false,"generics":{"params":[{"name":"T","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"maybe"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"provided_trait_methods":[],"trait":{"name":"Borrow","id":"2:2897:97","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"}}],"bindings":[]}}},"for":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"SecondsFormat","id":"0:2713:1920","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}},"items":["2:2905:2071"],"negative":false,"synthetic":false,"blanket_impl":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"}}},"0:1681:674":{"id":"0:1681:674","crate_id":0,"name":"fmt","span":{"filename":"src/naive/isoweek.rs","begin":[135,4],"end":[144,5]},"visibility":"default","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}],["f",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":true,"type":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"fmt::Formatter","id":"2:10543:135","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"lifetime":"'_"}],"bindings":[]}}}}}}]],"output":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"fmt::Result","id":"2:10532:211","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"5:856:8051":{"id":"5:856:8051","crate_id":5,"name":"Owned","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"The

Chrono: Date and Time for Rust\n\nIt aims to be a feature-complete superset of\nthe [time](https://github.com/rust-lang-deprecated/time) library.\nIn particular,\n\n* Chrono strictly adheres to ISO 8601.\n* Chrono is timezone-aware by default, with separate timezone-naive types.\n* Chrono is space-optimal and (while not being the primary goal) reasonably efficient.\n\nThere were several previous attempts to bring a good date and time library to Rust,\nwhich Chrono builds upon and should acknowledge:\n\n* [Initial research on\n   the wiki](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-wiki-backup/blob/master/Lib-datetime.md)\n* Dietrich Epp's [datetime-rs](https://github.com/depp/datetime-rs)\n* Luis de Bethencourt's [rust-datetime](https://github.com/luisbg/rust-datetime)\n\n### Features\n\nChrono supports various runtime environments and operating systems, and has\nseveral features that may be enabled or disabled.\n\nDefault features:\n\n- `alloc`: Enable features that depend on allocation (primarily string formatting)\n- `std`: Enables functionality that depends on the standard library. This\n  is a superset of `alloc` and adds interoperation with standard library types\n  and traits.\n- `clock`: Enables reading the system time (`now`) that depends on the standard library for\nUNIX-like operating systems and the Windows API (`winapi`) for Windows.\n\nOptional features:\n\n- [`serde`][]: Enable serialization/deserialization via serde.\n- `unstable-locales`: Enable localization. This adds various methods with a\n  `_localized` suffix. The implementation and API may change or even be\n  removed in a patch release. Feedback welcome.\n\n[`serde`]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde\n[wasm-bindgen]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen\n\nSee the [cargo docs][] for examples of specifying features.\n\n[cargo docs]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#choosing-features\n\n## Overview\n\n### Duration\n\nChrono currently uses its own [`Duration`] type to represent the magnitude\nof a time span. Since this has the same name as the newer, standard type for\nduration, the reference will refer this type as `OldDuration`.\n\nNote that this is an \"accurate\" duration represented as seconds and\nnanoseconds and does not represent \"nominal\" components such as days or\nmonths.\n\nWhen the `oldtime` feature is enabled, [`Duration`] is an alias for the\n[`time::Duration`](https://docs.rs/time/0.1.40/time/struct.Duration.html)\ntype from v0.1 of the time crate. time v0.1 is deprecated, so new code\nshould disable the `oldtime` feature and use the `chrono::Duration` type\ninstead. The `oldtime` feature is enabled by default for backwards\ncompatibility, but future versions of Chrono are likely to remove the\nfeature entirely.\n\nChrono does not yet natively support\nthe standard [`Duration`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Duration.html) type,\nbut it will be supported in the future.\nMeanwhile you can convert between two types with\n[`Duration::from_std`](https://docs.rs/time/0.1.40/time/struct.Duration.html#method.from_std)\nand\n[`Duration::to_std`](https://docs.rs/time/0.1.40/time/struct.Duration.html#method.to_std)\nmethods.\n\n### Date and Time\n\nChrono provides a\n[**`DateTime`**](./struct.DateTime.html)\ntype to represent a date and a time in a timezone.\n\nFor more abstract moment-in-time tracking such as internal timekeeping\nthat is unconcerned with timezones, consider\n[`time::SystemTime`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.SystemTime.html),\nwhich tracks your system clock, or\n[`time::Instant`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html), which\nis an opaque but monotonically-increasing representation of a moment in time.\n\n`DateTime` is timezone-aware and must be constructed from\nthe [**`TimeZone`**](./offset/trait.TimeZone.html) object,\nwhich defines how the local date is converted to and back from the UTC date.\nThere are three well-known `TimeZone` implementations:\n\n* [**`Utc`**](./offset/struct.Utc.html) specifies the UTC time zone. It is most efficient.\n\n* [**`Local`**](./offset/struct.Local.html) specifies the system local time zone.\n\n* [**`FixedOffset`**](./offset/struct.FixedOffset.html) specifies\n  an arbitrary, fixed time zone such as UTC+09:00 or UTC-10:30.\n  This often results from the parsed textual date and time.\n  Since it stores the most information and does not depend on the system environment,\n  you would want to normalize other `TimeZone`s into this type.\n\n`DateTime`s with different `TimeZone` types are distinct and do not mix,\nbut can be converted to each other using\nthe [`DateTime::with_timezone`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.with_timezone) method.\n\nYou can get the current date and time in the UTC time zone\n([`Utc::now()`](./offset/struct.Utc.html#method.now))\nor in the local time zone\n([`Local::now()`](./offset/struct.Local.html#method.now)).\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::prelude::*;\n\nlet utc: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now();       // e.g. `2014-11-28T12:45:59.324310806Z`\nlet local: DateTime<Local> = Local::now(); // e.g. `2014-11-28T21:45:59.324310806+09:00`\n# let _ = utc; let _ = local;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can create your own date and time.\nThis is a bit verbose due to Rust's lack of function and method overloading,\nbut in turn we get a rich combination of initialization methods.\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::prelude::*;\nuse chrono::offset::LocalResult;\n\nlet dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).unwrap();

This functionality is under the feature\n`unstable-locales`:\n\n```toml\nchrono = { version = \"0.4\", features = [\"unstable-locales\"] }\n```\n\nThe `unstable-locales` feature requires and implies at least the `alloc` feature.\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::prelude::*;\n\n# #[cfg(feature = \"unstable-locales\")]\n# fn test() {\nlet dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 11, 28, 12, 0, 9).unwrap();\nassert_eq!(dt.format(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\").to_string(), \"2014-11-28 12:00:09\");\nassert_eq!(dt.format(\"%a %b %e %T %Y\").to_string(), \"Fri Nov 28 12:00:09 2014\");\nassert_eq!(dt.format_localized(\"%A %e %B %Y, %T\", Locale::fr_BE).to_string(), \"vendredi 28 novembre 2014, 12:00:09\");\n\nassert_eq!(dt.format(\"%a %b %e %T %Y\").to_string(), dt.format(\"%c\").to_string());\nassert_eq!(dt.to_string(), \"2014-11-28 12:00:09 UTC\");\nassert_eq!(dt.to_rfc2822(), \"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 12:00:09 +0000\");\nassert_eq!(dt.to_rfc3339(), \"2014-11-28T12:00:09+00:00\");\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{:?}\", dt), \"2014-11-28T12:00:09Z\");\n\n// Note that milli/nanoseconds are only printed if they are non-zero\nlet dt_nano = NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2014, 11, 28).unwrap().and_hms_nano_opt(12, 0, 9, 1).unwrap().and_local_timezone(Utc).unwrap();\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{:?}\", dt_nano), \"2014-11-28T12:00:09.000000001Z\");\n# }\n# #[cfg(not(feature = \"unstable-locales\"))]\n# fn test() {}\n# if cfg!(feature = \"unstable-locales\") {\n#    test();\n# }\n```\n\nParsing can be done with three methods:\n\n1. The standard [`FromStr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html) trait\n   (and [`parse`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse) method\n   on a string) can be used for parsing `DateTime<FixedOffset>`, `DateTime<Utc>` and\n   `DateTime<Local>` values. This parses what the `{:?}`\n   ([`std::fmt::Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html))\n   format specifier prints, and requires the offset to be present.\n\n2. [`DateTime::parse_from_str`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.parse_from_str) parses\n   a date and time with offsets and returns `DateTime<FixedOffset>`.\n   This should be used when the offset is a part of input and the caller cannot guess that.\n   It *cannot* be used when the offset can be missing.\n   [`DateTime::parse_from_rfc2822`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.parse_from_rfc2822)\n   and\n   [`DateTime::parse_from_rfc3339`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.parse_from_rfc3339)\n   are similar but for well-known formats.\n\n3. [`Offset::datetime_from_str`](./offset/trait.TimeZone.html#method.datetime_from_str) is\n   similar but returns `DateTime` of given offset.\n   When the explicit offset is missing from the input, it simply uses given offset.\n   It issues an error when the input contains an explicit offset different\n   from the current offset.\n\nMore detailed control over the parsing process is available via\n[`format`](./format/index.html) module.\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::prelude::*;\n\nlet dt = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2014, 11, 28, 12, 0, 9).unwrap();\nlet fixed_dt = dt.with_timezone(&FixedOffset::east_opt(9*3600).unwrap());\n\n// method 1\nassert_eq!(\"2014-11-28T12:00:09Z\".parse::<DateTime<Utc>>(), Ok(dt.clone()));\nassert_eq!(\"2014-11-28T21:00:09+09:00\".parse::<DateTime<Utc>>(), Ok(dt.clone()));\nassert_eq!(\"2014-11-28T21:00:09+09:00\".parse::<DateTime<FixedOffset>>(), Ok(fixed_dt.clone()));\n\n// method 2\nassert_eq!(DateTime::parse_from_str(\"2014-11-28 21:00:09 +09:00\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\"),\n           Ok(fixed_dt.clone()));\nassert_eq!(DateTime::parse_from_rfc2822(\"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 21:00:09 +0900\"),\n           Ok(fixed_dt.clone()));\nassert_eq!(DateTime::parse_from_rfc3339(\"2014-11-28T21:00:09+09:00\"), Ok(fixed_dt.clone()));\n\n// method 3\nassert_eq!(Utc.datetime_from_str(\"2014-11-28 12:00:09\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"), Ok(dt.clone()));\nassert_eq!(Utc.datetime_from_str(\"Fri Nov 28 12:00:09 2014\", \"%a %b %e %T %Y\"), Ok(dt.clone()));\n\n// oops, the year is missing!\nassert!(Utc.datetime_from_str(\"Fri Nov 28 12:00:09\", \"%a %b %e %T %Y\").is_err());\n// oops, the format string does not include the year at all!\nassert!(Utc.datetime_from_str(\"Fri Nov 28 12:00:09\", \"%a %b %e %T\").is_err());\n// oops, the weekday is incorrect!\nassert!(Utc.datetime_from_str(\"Sat Nov 28 12:00:09 2014\", \"%a %b %e %T %Y\").is_err());\n```\n\nAgain : See [`format::strftime`](./format/strftime/index.html#specifiers)\ndocumentation for full syntax and list of specifiers.\n\n### Conversion from and to EPOCH timestamps\n\nUse [`Utc.timestamp(seconds, nanoseconds)`](./offset/trait.TimeZone.html#method.timestamp)\nto construct a [`DateTime<Utc>`](./struct.DateTime.html) from a UNIX timestamp\n(seconds, nanoseconds that passed since January 1st 1970).\n\nUse [`DateTime.timestamp`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.timestamp) to get the timestamp (in seconds)\nfrom a [`DateTime`](./struct.DateTime.html). Additionally, you can use\n[`DateTime.timestamp_subsec_nanos`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.timestamp_subsec_nanos)\nto get the number of additional number of nanoseconds.\n\n```rust\n// We need the trait in scope to use Utc::timestamp().\nuse chrono::{DateTime, TimeZone, Utc};\n\n// Construct a datetime from epoch:\nlet dt = Utc.timestamp(1_500_000_000, 0);\nassert_eq!(dt.to_rfc2822(), \"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 02:40:00 +0000\");\n\n// Get epoch value from a datetime:\nlet dt = DateTime::parse_from_rfc2822(\"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 02:40:00 +0000\").unwrap();\nassert_eq!(dt.timestamp(), 1_500_000_000);\n```\n\n### Individual date\n\nChrono also provides an individual date type ([**`Date`**](./struct.Date.html)).\nIt also has time zones attached, and have to be constructed via time zones.\nMost operations available to `DateTime` are also available to `Date` whenever appropriate.\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::prelude::*;\nuse chrono::offset::LocalResult;\n\n# // these *may* fail, but only very rarely. just rerun the test if you were that unfortunate ;)\nassert_eq!(Utc::today(), Utc::now().date());\nassert_eq!(Local::today(), Local::now().date());\n\nassert_eq!(Utc.ymd_opt(2014, 11, 28).unwrap().weekday(), Weekday::Fri);\nassert_eq!(Utc.ymd_opt(2014, 11, 31), LocalResult::None);\nassert_eq!(NaiveDate::from_ymd_opt(2014, 11, 28).unwrap().and_hms_milli_opt(7, 8, 9, 10).unwrap().and_local_timezone(Utc).unwrap().format(\"%H%M%S\").to_string(),\n           \"070809\");\n```\n\nThere is no timezone-aware `Time` due to the lack of usefulness and also the complexity.\n\n`DateTime` has [`date`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.date) method\nwhich returns a `Date` which represents its date component.\nThere is also a [`time`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.time) method,\nwhich simply returns a naive local time described below.\n\n### Naive date and time\n\nChrono provides naive counterparts to `Date`, (non-existent) `Time` and `DateTime`\nas [**`NaiveDate`**](./naive/struct.NaiveDate.html),\n[**`NaiveTime`**](./naive/struct.NaiveTime.html) and\n[**`NaiveDateTime`**](./naive/struct.NaiveDateTime.html) respectively.\n\nThey have almost equivalent interfaces as their timezone-aware twins,\nbut are not associated to time zones obviously and can be quite low-level.\nThey are mostly useful for building blocks for higher-level types.\n\nTimezone-aware `DateTime` and `Date` types have two methods returning naive versions:\n[`naive_local`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.naive_local) returns\na view to the naive local time,\nand [`naive_utc`](./struct.DateTime.html#method.naive_utc) returns\na view to the naive UTC time.\n\n## Limitations\n\nOnly proleptic Gregorian calendar (i.e. extended to support older dates) is supported.\nBe very careful if you really have to deal with pre-20C dates, they can be in Julian or others.\n\nDate types are limited in about +/- 262,000 years from the common epoch.\nTime types are limited in the nanosecond accuracy.\n\n[Leap seconds are supported in the representation but\nChrono doesn't try to make use of them](./naive/struct.NaiveTime.html#leap-second-handling).\n(The main reason is that leap seconds are not really predictable.)\nAlmost *every* operation over the possible leap seconds will ignore them.\nConsider using `NaiveDateTime` with the implicit TAI (International Atomic Time) scale\nif you want.\n\nChrono inherently does not support an inaccurate or partial date and time representation.\nAny operation that can be ambiguous will return `None` in such cases.\nFor example, \"a month later\" of 2014-01-30 is not well-defined\nand consequently `Utc.ymd_opt(2014, 1, 30).unwrap().with_month(2)` returns `None`.\n\nNon ISO week handling is not yet supported.\nFor now you can use the [chrono_ext](https://crates.io/crates/chrono_ext)\ncrate ([sources](https://github.com/bcourtine/chrono-ext/)).\n\nAdvanced time zone handling is not yet supported.\nFor now you can try the [Chrono-tz](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono-tz/) crate instead.","links":{"`Duration`":"20:405:122"},"attrs":["#![doc(html_root_url =

This is one of the more powerful methods in the standard\nlibrary, used in a variety of contexts.\n\nThe most basic pattern in which `collect()` is used is to turn one\ncollection into another. You take a collection, call [`iter`] on it,\ndo a bunch of transformations, and then `collect()` at the end.\n\n`collect()` can also create instances of types that are not typical\ncollections. For example, a [`String`] can be built from [`char`]s,\nand an iterator of [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`] items can be collected\ninto `Result<Collection<T>, E>`. See the examples below for more.\n\nBecause `collect()` is so general, it can cause problems with type\ninference. As such, `collect()` is one of the few times you'll see\nthe syntax affectionately known as the 'turbofish': `::<>`. This\nhelps the inference algorithm understand specifically which collection\nyou're trying to collect into.\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled: Vec<i32> = a.iter()\n                         .map(|&x| x * 2)\n                         .collect();\n\nassert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n```\n\nNote that we needed the `: Vec<i32>` on the left-hand side. This is because\nwe could collect into, for example, a [`VecDeque<T>`] instead:\n\n[`VecDeque<T>`]: ../../std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html\n\n```\nuse std::collections::VecDeque;\n\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled: VecDeque<i32> = a.iter().map(|&x| x * 2).collect();\n\nassert_eq!(2, doubled[0]);\nassert_eq!(4, doubled[1]);\nassert_eq!(6, doubled[2]);\n```\n\nUsing the 'turbofish' instead of annotating `doubled`:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<i32>>();\n\nassert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n```\n\nBecause `collect()` only cares about what you're collecting into, you can\nstill use a partial type hint, `_`, with the turbofish:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\nlet doubled = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<_>>();\n\nassert_eq!(vec![2, 4, 6], doubled);\n```\n\nUsing `collect()` to make a [`String`]:\n\n```\nlet chars = ['g', 'd', 'k', 'k', 'n'];\n\nlet hello: String = chars.iter()\n    .map(|&x| x as u8)\n    .map(|x| (x + 1) as char)\n    .collect();\n\nassert_eq!(\"hello\", hello);\n```\n\nIf you have a list of [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`]s, you can use `collect()` to\nsee if any of them failed:\n\n```\nlet results = [Ok(1), Err(\"nope\"), Ok(3), Err(\"bad\")];\n\nlet result: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = results.iter().cloned().collect();\n\n// gives us the first error\nassert_eq!(Err(\"nope\"), result);\n\nlet results = [Ok(1), Ok(3)];\n\nlet result: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = results.iter().cloned().collect();\n\n// gives us the list of answers\nassert_eq!(Ok(vec![1, 3]), result);\n```\n\n[`iter`]: Iterator::next\n[`String`]: ../../std/string/struct.String.html\n[`char`]: type@char","links":{"type@char":"1:16033:7037","`Result`":"2:51367:211","Iterator::next":"2:8907:952"},"attrs":["#[must_use =\n\"if you really need to exhaust the iterator, consider `.for_each(drop)` instead\"]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}]],"output":{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"B","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"B"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"FromIterator","id":"2:8705:137","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"Item","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"trait":{"name":"Iterator","id":"2:8905:160","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}}],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}},{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"1:6367:62184":{"id":"1:6367:62184","crate_id":1,"name":"into_pthread_t","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Consumes the thread, returning the raw pthread_t\n\nThis function **transfers ownership** of the underlying pthread_t to\nthe caller.

a single `str` into this hasher.\n\nIf you're implementing [`Hash`], you generally do not need to call this,\nas the `impl Hash for str` does, so you should prefer that instead.\n\nThis includes the domain separator for prefix-freedom, so you should\n**not** call `Self::write_length_prefix` before calling this.\n\n# Note to Implementers\n\nThere are at least two reasonable default ways to implement this.\nWhich one will be the default is not yet decided, so for now\nyou probably want to override it specifically.\n\n## The general answer\n\nIt's always correct to implement this with a length prefix:\n\n```\n# #![feature(hasher_prefixfree_extras)]\n# struct Foo;\n# impl std::hash::Hasher for Foo {\n# fn finish(&self) -> u64 { unimplemented!() }\n# fn write(&mut self, _bytes: &[u8]) { unimplemented!() }\nfn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) {\n    self.write_length_prefix(s.len());\n    self.write(s.as_bytes());\n}\n# }\n```\n\nAnd, if your `Hasher` works in `usize` chunks, this is likely a very\nefficient way to do it, as anything more complicated may well end up\nslower than just running the round with the length.\n\n## If your `Hasher` works byte-wise\n\nOne nice thing about `str` being UTF-8 is that the `b'\\xFF'` byte\nnever happens.  That means that you can append that to the byte stream\nbeing hashed and maintain prefix-freedom:\n\n```\n# #![feature(hasher_prefixfree_extras)]\n# struct Foo;\n# impl std::hash::Hasher for Foo {\n# fn finish(&self) -> u64 { unimplemented!() }\n# fn write(&mut self, _bytes: &[u8]) { unimplemented!() }\nfn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) {\n    self.write(s.as_bytes());\n    self.write_u8(0xff);\n}\n# }\n```\n\nThis does require that your implementation not add extra padding, and\nthus generally requires that you maintain a buffer, running a round\nonly once that buffer is full (or `finish` is called).\n\nThat's because if `write` pads data out to a fixed chunk size, it's\nlikely that it does it in such a way that `\"a\"` and `\"a\\x00\"` would\nend up hashing the same sequence of things, introducing conflicts.","links":{"`Hash`":"2:10828:143"},"attrs":["#[unstable(feature = \"hasher_prefixfree_extras\", issue =

(e.g. `%e` = ` 9`, `%0e` = `09`)\n\nNotes:\n\n[^1]: `%C`, `%y`:\n   This is floor division, so 100 BCE (year number -99) will print `-1` and `99` respectively.\n\n[^2]: `%U`:\n   Week 1 starts with the first Sunday in that year.\n   It is possible to have week 0 for days before the first Sunday.\n\n[^3]: `%G`, `%g`, `%V`:\n   Week 1 is the first week with at least 4 days in that year.\n   Week 0 does not exist, so this should be used with `%G` or `%g`.\n\n[^4]: `%S`:\n   It accounts for leap seconds, so `60` is possible.\n\n[^5]: `%+`: Same as `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%.f%:z`, i.e. 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional\n   digits for seconds and colons in the time zone offset.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   This format also supports having a `Z` or `UTC` in place of `%:z`. They\n   are equivalent to `+00:00`.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   Note that all `T`, `Z`, and `UTC` are parsed case-insensitively.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   The typical `strftime` implementations have different (and locale-dependent)\n   formats for this specifier. While Chrono's format for `%+` is far more\n   stable, it is best to avoid this specifier if you want to control the exact\n   output.\n\n[^6]: `%s`:\n   This is not padded and can be negative.\n   For the purpose of Chrono, it only accounts for non-leap seconds\n   so it slightly differs from ISO C `strftime` behavior.\n\n[^7]: `%f`, `%.f`, `%.3f`, `%.6f`, `%.9f`, `%3f`, `%6f`, `%9f`:\n   <br>\n   The default `%f` is right-aligned and always zero-padded to 9 digits\n   for the compatibility with glibc and others,\n   so it always counts the number of nanoseconds since the last whole second.\n   E.g. 7ms after the last second will print `007000000`,\n   and parsing `7000000` will yield the same.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   The variant `%.f` is left-aligned and print 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits\n   according to the precision.\n   E.g. 70ms after the last second under `%.f` will print `.070` (note: not `.07`),\n   and parsing `.07`, `.070000` etc. will yield the same.\n   Note that they can print or read nothing if the fractional part is zero or\n   the next character is not `.`.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   The variant `%.3f`, `%.6f` and `%.9f` are left-aligned and print 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits\n   according to the number preceding `f`.\n   E.g. 70ms after the last second under `%.3f` will print `.070` (note: not `.07`),\n   and parsing `.07`, `.070000` etc. will yield the same.\n   Note that they can read nothing if the fractional part is zero or\n   the next character is not `.` however will print with the specified length.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   The variant `%3f`, `%6f` and `%9f` are left-aligned and print 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits\n   according to the number preceding `f`, but without the leading dot.\n   E.g. 70ms after the last second under `%3f` will print `070` (note: not `07`),\n   and parsing `07`, `070000` etc. will yield the same.\n   Note that they can read nothing if the fractional part is zero.\n\n[^8]: `%Z`:\n   Offset will not be populated from the parsed data, nor will it be validated.\n   Timezone is completely ignored. Similar to the glibc `strptime` treatment of\n   this format code.\n   <br>\n   <br>\n   It is not possible to reliably convert from an abbreviation to an offset,\n   for example CDT can mean either Central Daylight Time (North America) or\n   China Daylight Time.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"module","inner":{"is_crate":false,"items":["0:3047:2082"],"is_stripped":false}},"0:2692:2538":{"id":"0:2692:2538","crate_id":0,"name":"second","span":{"filename":"src/traits.rs","begin":[142,4],"end":[142,28]},"visibility":"default","docs":"Returns the second number from 0 to 59.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}]],"output":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"u32"},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":false}},"2:11244:58907":{"id":"2:11244:58907","crate_id":2,"name":"get_unchecked_mut","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Returns a mutable reference to the output at this location, without\nperforming any bounds checking.\nCalling this method with an out-of-bounds index or a dangling `slice` pointer\nis *[undefined behavior]* even if the resulting reference is not used.\n\n[undefined behavior]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html","links":{},"attrs":["#[unstable(feature = \"slice_index_methods\", issue = \"none\")]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}],["slice",{"kind":"raw_pointer","inner":{"mutable":true,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"}}}]],"output":{"kind":"raw_pointer","inner":{"mutable":true,"type":{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"Output","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"trait":{"name":"SliceIndex","id":"2:11238:222","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"}}],"bindings":[]}}}}}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":true,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":false}},"2:9015:304":{"id":"2:9015:304","crate_id":2,"name":"any","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Tests if any element of the iterator matches a predicate.\n\n`any()` takes a closure that returns `true` or `false`.

In some\ncases `for_each` may also be faster than a loop, because it will use\ninternal iteration on adapters like `Chain`.\n\n[`for`]: ../../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nuse std::sync::mpsc::channel;\n\nlet (tx, rx) = channel();\n(0..5).map(|x| x * 2 + 1)\n      .for_each(move |x| tx.send(x).unwrap());\n\nlet v: Vec<_> =  rx.iter().collect();\nassert_eq!(v, vec![1, 3, 5, 7, 9]);\n```\n\nFor such a small example, a `for` loop may be cleaner, but `for_each`\nmight be preferable to keep a functional style with longer iterators:\n\n```\n(0..5).flat_map(|x| x * 100 .. x * 110)\n      .enumerate()\n      .filter(|&(i, x)| (i + x) % 3 == 0)\n      .for_each(|(i, x)| println!(\"{i}:{x}\"));\n```","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}],["f",{"kind":"generic","inner":"F"}]],"output":null,"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"F","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}},{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"F"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"FnMut","id":"2:3697:132","args":{"parenthesized":{"inputs":[{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"Item","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"trait":{"name":"Iterator","id":"2:8905:160","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}],"output":null}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"0:456:685":{"id":"0:456:685","crate_id":0,"name":"format","span":{"filename":"src/datetime/mod.rs","begin":[704,4],"end":[706,5]},"visibility":"public","docs":"Formats the combined date and time with the specified format string.\nSee the [`crate::format::strftime`] module\non the supported escape sequences.\n\n# Example\n```rust\nuse chrono::prelude::*;\n\nlet date_time: DateTime<Utc> = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2017, 04, 02, 12, 50, 32).unwrap();\nlet formatted = format!(\"{}\", date_time.format(\"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M\"));\nassert_eq!(formatted, \"02/04/2017 12:50\");\n```","links":{"`crate::format::strftime`":"0:1040:2666"},"attrs":["#[cfg(any(feature = \"alloc\", feature = \"std\", test))]","#[inline]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}],["fmt",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":"'a","mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"str"}}}]],"output":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"DelayedFormat","id":"0:3066:2080","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"StrftimeItems","id":"0:3047:2082","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"lifetime":"'a"}],"bindings":[]}}}}}],"bindings":[]}}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"'a","kind":{"lifetime":{"outlives":[]}}}],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"0:240":{"id":"0:240","crate_id":0,"name":null,"span":{"filename":"src/date.rs","begin":[509,0],"end":[516,1]},"visibility":{"restricted":{"parent":"0:65:1932","path":"::date"}},"docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"impl","inner":{"is_unsafe":false,"generics":{"params":[{"name":"Tz","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"TimeZone","id":"0:2488:1931","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[]},"provided_trait_methods":[],"trait":{"name":"Sub","id":"2:3514:2074","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Date","id":"0:2706:1914","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Tz"}}],"bindings":[]}}}}}],"bindings":[]}}},"for":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Date","id":"0:2706:1914","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Tz"}}],"bindings":[]}}}},"items":["0:242:186","0:243:1397"],"negative":false,"synthetic":false,"blanket_impl":null}},"2:14600:62521":{"id":"2:14600:62521","crate_id":2,"name":"grow","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"Attempts to extend the memory block.\n\nReturns a new [`NonNull<[u8]>`][NonNull] containing a pointer and the actual size of the allocated\nmemory.

is a double reference:\n\n```\nlet a = [-1, 0, 1];\n\nlet mut iter = a.iter().take_while(|x| **x < 0); // need two *s!\n\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&-1));\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\nStopping after an initial `false`:\n\n```\nlet a = [-1, 0, 1, -2];\n\nlet mut iter = a.iter().take_while(|x| **x < 0);\n\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(&-1));\n\n// We have more elements that are less than zero, but since we already\n// got a false, take_while() isn't used any more\nassert_eq!(iter.next(), None);\n```\n\nBecause `take_while()` needs to look at the value in order to see if it\nshould be included or not, consuming iterators will see that it is\nremoved:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nlet mut iter = a.iter();\n\nlet result: Vec<i32> = iter.by_ref()\n                           .take_while(|n| **n != 3)\n                           .cloned()\n                           .collect();\n\nassert_eq!(result, &[1, 2]);\n\nlet result: Vec<i32> = iter.cloned().collect();\n\nassert_eq!(result, &[4]);\n```\n\nThe `3` is no longer there, because it was consumed in order to see if\nthe iteration should stop, but wasn't placed back into the iterator.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}],["predicate",{"kind":"generic","inner":"P"}]],"output":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"TakeWhile","id":"2:50503:8532","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}},{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"P"}}],"bindings":[]}}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"P","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}},{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"P"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"FnMut","id":"2:3697:132","args":{"parenthesized":{"inputs":[{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"qualified_path","inner":{"name":"Item","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"self_type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"},"trait":{"name":"Iterator","id":"2:8905:160","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}}}],"output":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"bool"}}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":true}},"2:3570:186":{"id":"2:3570:186","crate_id":2,"name":"Output","span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":"The

8601 calendar date with time zone.\n\nYou almost certainly want to be using a [`NaiveDate`] instead of this type.\n\nThis type primarily exists to aid in the construction of DateTimes that\nhave a timezone by way of the [`TimeZone`] datelike constructors (e.g.\n[`TimeZone::ymd`]).\n\nThis type should be considered ambiguous at best, due to the inherent lack\nof precision required for the time zone resolution.\n\nThere are some guarantees on the usage of `Date<Tz>`:\n\n- If properly constructed via [`TimeZone::ymd`] and others without an error,\n  the corresponding local date should exist for at least a moment.\n  (It may still have a gap from the offset changes.)\n\n- The `TimeZone` is free to assign *any* [`Offset`](crate::offset::Offset) to the\n  local date, as long as that offset did occur in given day.\n\n  For example, if `2015-03-08T01:59-08:00` is followed by `2015-03-08T03:00-07:00`,\n  it may produce either `2015-03-08-08:00` or `2015-03-08-07:00`\n  but *not* `2015-03-08+00:00` and others.\n\n- Once constructed as a full `DateTime`, [`DateTime::date`] and other associated\n  methods should return those for the original `Date`. For example, if `dt =\n  tz.ymd_opt(y,m,d).unwrap().hms(h,n,s)` were valid, `dt.date() == tz.ymd_opt(y,m,d).unwrap()`.\n\n- The date is timezone-agnostic up to one day (i.e. practically always),\n  so the local date and UTC date should be equal for most cases\n  even though the raw calculation between `NaiveDate` and `Duration` may not.","links":{"`TimeZone::ymd`":"0:2492:3200","`NaiveDate`":"0:3099:1927","crate::offset::Offset":"0:2486:1930","`TimeZone`":"0:2488:1931","`DateTime::date`":"0:386:1932"},"attrs":["#[deprecated(since

iterator method that reduces the iterator's elements to a single,\nfinal value, starting from the back.\n\nThis is the reverse version of [`Iterator::fold()`]: it takes elements\nstarting from the back of the iterator.\n\n`rfold()` takes two arguments: an initial value, and a closure with two\narguments: an 'accumulator', and an element. The closure returns the value that\nthe accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n\nThe initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\ncall.\n\nAfter applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `rfold()`\nreturns the accumulator.\n\nThis operation is sometimes called 'reduce' or 'inject'.\n\nFolding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want\nto produce a single value from it.\n\nNote: `rfold()` combines elements in a *right-associative* fashion. For associative\noperators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for non-associative\noperators like `-` the order will affect the final result.\nFor a *left-associative* version of `rfold()`, see [`Iterator::fold()`].\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// the sum of all of the elements of a\nlet sum = a.iter()\n

The closure either\nreturns successfully, with the value that the accumulator should have\nfor the next iteration, or it returns failure, with an error value that\nis propagated back to the caller immediately (short-circuiting).\n\nThe initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first\ncall.

If multiple calls are needed,\nthe `?` operator may be convenient for chaining the accumulator value\nalong, but beware any invariants that need to be upheld before those\nearly returns.

If an error is returned then no bytes\nin the buffer were written to this writer.\n\nIt is **not** considered an error if the entire buffer could not be\nwritten to this writer.\n\nAn error of the [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] kind is non-fatal and the\nwrite operation should be retried if there is nothing else to do.\n\n# Examples\n\n```no_run\nuse std::io::prelude::*;\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nfn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n    let mut buffer = File::create(\"foo.txt\")?;\n\n    // Writes some prefix of the byte string, not necessarily all of it.\n    buffer.write(b\"some bytes\")?;\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n[`Ok(n)`]: Ok","links":{"`ErrorKind::Interrupted`":"1:10860:8489","`Err`":"2:51373:127","Ok":"2:51370:180"},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":true,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}],["buf",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"slice","inner":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"u8"}}}}]],"output":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Result","id":"2:51367:211","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"usize"}},{"type":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Error","id":"1:3830:128","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}}}],"bindings":[]}}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":{"const":false,"unsafe":false,"async":false,"abi":"Rust"},"has_body":false}},"b:2:2906-0:3701:1953":{"id":"b:2:2906-0:3701:1953","crate_id":0,"name":null,"span":null,"visibility":"default","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"impl","inner":{"is_unsafe":false,"generics":{"params":[{"name":"T","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null,"synthetic":false}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"name":"Sized","id":"2:3424:5842","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"maybe"}}],"generic_params":[]}}]},"provided_trait_methods":[],"trait":{"name":"BorrowMut","id":"2:2900:98","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"}}],"bindings":[]}}},"for":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Months","id":"0:3701:1953","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}}}},"items":["2:2908:6020"],"negative":false,"synthetic":false,"blanket_impl":{"kind":"generic","inner":"T"}}},"23:341:8232":{"id":"23:341:8232","crate_id":23,"name":"from_u8","span":{"filename":"/home/runner/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/num-traits-0.2.15/src/cast.rs","begin":[467,4],"end":[467,37]},"visibility":"default","docs":"Converts an `u8` to return an optional value of this type.
