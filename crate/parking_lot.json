The write portion of this lock typically allows modification\nof the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock\ntypically allows for read-only access (shared access).\n\nThis lock uses a task-fair locking policy which avoids both reader and\nwriter starvation. This means that readers trying to acquire the lock will\nblock even if the lock is unlocked when there are writers waiting to acquire\nthe lock. Because of this, attempts to recursively acquire a read lock\nwithin a single thread may result in a deadlock.\n\nThe type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is\nrequired that `T` satisfies `Send` to be shared across threads and `Sync` to\nallow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards returned from the\nlocking methods implement `Deref` (and `DerefMut` for the `write` methods)\nto allow access to the contained of the lock.\n\n# Fairness\n\nA typical unfair lock can often end up in a situation where a single thread\nquickly acquires and releases the same lock in succession, which can starve\nother threads waiting to acquire the rwlock. While this improves throughput\nbecause it doesn't force a context switch when a thread tries to re-acquire\na rwlock it has just released, this can starve other threads.\n\nThis rwlock uses [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)\nto ensure that the lock will be fair on average without sacrificing\nthroughput. This is done by forcing a fair unlock on average every 0.5ms,\nwhich will force the lock to go to the next thread waiting for the rwlock.\n\nAdditionally, any critical section longer than 1ms will always use a fair\nunlock, which has a negligible impact on throughput considering the length\nof the critical section.\n\nYou can also force a fair unlock by calling `RwLockReadGuard::unlock_fair`\nor `RwLockWriteGuard::unlock_fair` when unlocking a mutex instead of simply\ndropping the guard.\n\n# Differences from the standard library `RwLock`\n\n- Supports atomically downgrading a write lock into a read lock.\n- Task-fair locking policy instead of an unspecified platform default.\n- No poisoning, the lock is released normally on panic.\n- Only requires 1 word of space, whereas the standard library boxes the\n  `RwLock` due to platform limitations.\n- Can be statically constructed.\n- Does not require any drop glue when dropped.\n- Inline fast path for the uncontended case.\n- Efficient handling of micro-contention using adaptive spinning.\n- Allows raw locking & unlocking without a guard.\n- Supports eventual fairness so that the rwlock is fair on average.\n- Optionally allows making the rwlock fair by calling\n  `RwLockReadGuard::unlock_fair` and `RwLockWriteGuard::unlock_fair`.\n\n# Examples\n\n```\nuse parking_lot::RwLock;\n\nlet lock = RwLock::new(5);\n\n// many reader locks can be held at once\n{\n    let r1 = lock.read();\n    let r2 = lock.read();\n    assert_eq!(*r1, 5);\n    assert_eq!(*r2, 5);\n} // read locks are dropped at this point\n\n// only one write lock may be held, however\n{\n    let mut w = lock.write();\n    *w += 1;\n    assert_eq!(*w, 6);\n} // write lock is dropped

Condition Variable\n\nCondition variables represent the ability to block a thread such that it\nconsumes no CPU time while waiting for an event to occur. Condition\nvariables are typically associated with a boolean predicate (a condition)\nand a mutex. The predicate is always verified inside of the mutex before\ndetermining that thread must block.\n\nNote that this module places one additional restriction over the system\ncondition variables: each condvar can be used with only one mutex at a\ntime. Any attempt to use multiple mutexes on the same condition variable\nsimultaneously will result in a runtime panic. However it is possible to\nswitch to a different mutex if there are no threads currently waiting on\nthe condition variable.\n\n# Differences from the standard library `Condvar`\n\n- No spurious wakeups: A wait will only return a non-timeout result if it\n  was woken up by `notify_one` or `notify_all`.\n- `Condvar::notify_all` will only wake up a single thread, the rest are\n  requeued to wait for the `Mutex` to be unlocked by the thread that was\n  woken up.\n- Only requires 1 word of space, whereas the standard library boxes the\n  `Condvar` due to platform limitations.\n- Can be statically constructed.\n- Does not require any drop glue when dropped.\n- Inline fast path for the uncontended case.\n\n# Examples\n\n```\nuse parking_lot::{Mutex, Condvar};\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::thread;\n\nlet pair = Arc::new((Mutex::new(false), Condvar::new()));\nlet pair2 = pair.clone();\n\n// Inside of our lock, spawn a new thread, and then wait for it to start\nthread::spawn(move|| {\n    let &(ref lock, ref cvar) = &*pair2;\n    let mut started = lock.lock();\n    *started = true;\n    cvar.notify_one();\n});\n\n// wait for the thread to start up\nlet &(ref lock, ref cvar) = &*pair;\nlet mut started = lock.lock();\nif !*started {\n    cvar.wait(&mut started);\n}\n// Note that we used an if instead of a while loop above.

The\nmutex can be statically initialized or created by the `new`\nconstructor. Each mutex has a type parameter which represents the data that\nit is protecting. The data can only be accessed through the RAII guards\nreturned from `lock` and `try_lock`, which guarantees that the data is only\never accessed when the mutex is locked.\n\n# Fairness\n\nA typical unfair lock can often end up in a situation where a single thread\nquickly acquires and releases the same mutex in succession, which can starve\nother threads waiting to acquire the mutex. While this improves throughput\nbecause it doesn't force a context switch when a thread tries to re-acquire\na mutex it has just released, this can starve other threads.\n\nThis mutex uses [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)\nto ensure that the lock will be fair on average without sacrificing\nthroughput. This is done by forcing a fair unlock on average every 0.5ms,\nwhich will force the lock to go to the next thread waiting for the mutex.\n\nAdditionally, any critical section longer than 1ms will always use a fair\nunlock, which has a negligible impact on throughput considering the length\nof the critical section.\n\nYou can also force a fair unlock by calling `MutexGuard::unlock_fair` when\nunlocking a mutex instead of simply dropping the `MutexGuard`.\n\n# Differences from the standard library `Mutex`\n\n- No poisoning, the lock is released normally on panic.\n- Only requires 1 byte of space, whereas the standard library boxes the\n  `Mutex` due to platform limitations.\n- Can be statically constructed.\n- Does not require any drop glue when dropped.\n- Inline fast path for the uncontended case.\n- Efficient handling of micro-contention using adaptive spinning.\n- Allows raw locking & unlocking without a guard.\n- Supports eventual fairness so that the mutex is fair on average.\n- Optionally allows making the mutex fair by calling `MutexGuard::unlock_fair`.\n\n# Examples\n\n```\nuse parking_lot::Mutex;\nuse std::sync::{Arc, mpsc::channel};\nuse std::thread;\n\nconst
