It is used to stream the message\nbody and send the message trailers. See method level documentation for more\ndetails.\n\nThe `SendStream` instance is also used to manage outbound flow control.\n\nIf a `SendStream` is dropped without explicitly closing the send stream, a\n`RST_STREAM` frame will be sent. This essentially cancels the request /\nresponse exchange.\n\nThe ways to explicitly close the send stream are:\n\n* Set `end_of_stream` to true when calling [`send_request`],\n  [`send_response`], or [`send_data`].\n* Send trailers with [`send_trailers`].\n* Explicitly reset the stream with [`send_reset`].\n\n# Flow control\n\nIn HTTP/2, data cannot be sent to the remote peer unless there is\navailable window capacity on both the stream and the connection. When a data\nframe is sent, both the stream window and the connection window are\ndecremented. When the stream level window reaches zero, no further data can\nbe sent on that stream. When the connection level window reaches zero, no\nfurther data can be sent on any stream for that connection.\n\nWhen the remote peer is ready to receive more data, it sends `WINDOW_UPDATE`\nframes. These frames increment the windows. See the [specification] for more\ndetails on the principles of HTTP/2 flow control.\n\nThe implications for sending data are that the caller **should** ensure that\nboth the stream and the connection has available window capacity before\nloading the data to send into memory. The `SendStream` instance provides the\nnecessary APIs to perform this logic. This, however, is not an obligation.\nIf the caller attempts to send data on a stream when there is no available\nwindow capacity, the library will buffer the data until capacity becomes\navailable, at which point the buffer will be flushed to the connection.\n\n**NOTE**: There is no bound on the amount of data that the library will\nbuffer. If you are sending large amounts of data, you really should hook\ninto the flow control lifecycle. Otherwise, you risk using up significant\namounts of memory.\n\nTo hook into the flow control lifecycle, the caller signals to the library\nthat it intends to send data by calling [`reserve_capacity`], specifying the\namount of data, in octets, that the caller intends to send. After this,\n`poll_capacity` is used to be notified when the requested capacity is\nassigned to the stream. Once [`poll_capacity`] returns `Ready` with the number\nof octets available to the stream, the caller is able to actually send the\ndata using [`send_data`].\n\nBecause there is also a connection level window that applies to **all**\nstreams on a connection, when capacity is assigned to a stream (indicated by\n`poll_capacity` returning `Ready`), this capacity is reserved on the\nconnection and will **not** be assigned to any other stream. If data is\nnever written to the stream, that capacity is effectively lost to other\nstreams and this introduces the risk of deadlocking a connection.\n\nTo avoid throttling data on a connection, the caller should not reserve\ncapacity until ready to send data and once any capacity is assigned to the\nstream, the caller should immediately send data consuming this capacity.\nThere is no guarantee as to when the full capacity requested will become\navailable. For example, if the caller requests 64 KB of data and 512 bytes\nbecome available, the caller should immediately send 512 bytes of data.\n\nSee [`reserve_capacity`] documentation for more details.\n\n[`SendRequest`]: client/struct.SendRequest.html\n[`SendResponse`]: server/struct.SendResponse.html\n[specification]: http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#FlowControl\n[`reserve_capacity`]:

implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol.\n\n# Getting started\n\nRunning an HTTP/2 client requires the caller to establish the underlying\nconnection as well as get the connection to a state that is ready to begin\nthe HTTP/2 handshake. See [here](../index.html#handshake) for more\ndetails.\n\nThis could be as basic as using Tokio's [`TcpStream`] to connect to a remote\nhost, but usually it means using either ALPN or HTTP/1.1 protocol upgrades.\n\nOnce a connection is obtained, it is passed to [`handshake`], which will\nbegin the [HTTP/2 handshake]. This returns a future that completes once\nthe handshake process is performed and HTTP/2 streams may be initialized.\n\n[`handshake`] uses default configuration values. There are a number of\nsettings that can be changed by using [`Builder`] instead.\n\nOnce the handshake future completes, the caller is provided with a\n[`Connection`] instance and a [`SendRequest`] instance. The [`Connection`]\ninstance is used to drive the connection (see [Managing the connection]).\nThe [`SendRequest`] instance is used to initialize new streams (see [Making\nrequests]).\n\n# Making requests\n\nRequests are made using the [`SendRequest`] handle provided by the handshake\nfuture. Once a request is submitted, an HTTP/2 stream is initialized and\nthe request is sent to the server.\n\nA request body and request trailers are sent using [`SendRequest`] and the\nserver's response is returned once the [`ResponseFuture`] future completes.\nBoth the [`SendStream`] and [`ResponseFuture`] instances are returned by\n[`SendRequest::send_request`] and are tied to the HTTP/2 stream\ninitialized by the sent request.\n\nThe [`SendRequest::poll_ready`] function returns `Ready` when a new HTTP/2\nstream can be created, i.e. as long as the current number of active streams\nis below [`MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`]. If a new stream cannot be created, the\ncaller will be notified once an existing stream closes, freeing capacity for\nthe caller.  The caller should use [`SendRequest::poll_ready`] to check for\ncapacity before sending a request to the server.\n\n[`SendRequest`] enforces the [`MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS`] setting. The user\nmust not send a request if `poll_ready` does not return `Ready`. Attempting\nto do so will result in an [`Error`] being returned.\n\n# Managing the connection\n\nThe [`Connection`] instance is used to manage connection state. The caller\nis required to call [`Connection::poll`] in order to advance state.\n[`SendRequest::send_request`] and other functions have no effect unless\n[`Connection::poll`] is called.\n\nThe [`Connection`] instance should only be dropped once [`Connection::poll`]\nreturns `Ready`. At this point, the underlying socket has been closed and no\nfurther work needs to be done.\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that the [`Connection`] instance gets polled is to\nsubmit the [`Connection`] instance to an [executor]. The executor will then\nmanage polling the connection until the connection is complete.\nAlternatively, the caller can call `poll` manually.\n\n# Example\n\n```rust, no_run\n\nuse h2::client;\n\nuse http::{Request, Method};\nuse std::error::Error;\nuse tokio::net::TcpStream;\n\n#[tokio::main]\npub async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {\n    // Establish TCP connection to the server.\n    let tcp = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:5928\").await?;\n    let (h2, connection) = client::handshake(tcp).await?;\n    tokio::spawn(async move {\n        connection.await.unwrap();\n    });\n\n    let mut h2 = h2.ready().await?;\n    // Prepare the HTTP request to send to the server.\n    let request = Request::builder()\n                    .method(Method::GET)\n                    .uri(\"https://www.example.com/\")\n                    .body(())\n                    .unwrap();\n\n    // Send the request. The second tuple item allows the caller\n    // to stream a request body.\n    let (response, _) = h2.send_request(request, true).unwrap();\n\n    let (head, mut body) = response.await?.into_parts();\n\n    println!(\"Received response: {:?}\", head);\n\n    // The `flow_control` handle allows the caller to manage\n    // flow control.\n    //\n    // Whenever data is received, the caller is responsible for\n    // releasing capacity back to the server once it has freed\n    // the data from memory.\n    let mut flow_control = body.flow_control().clone();\n\n    while let Some(chunk) = body.data().await {\n        let chunk = chunk?;\n        println!(\"RX: {:?}\", chunk);\n\n        // Let the server send more data.\n        let _ = flow_control.release_capacity(chunk.len());\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n[`TcpStream`]: https://docs.rs/tokio-core/0.1/tokio_core/net/struct.TcpStream.html\n[`handshake`]:

handle to release window capacity to a remote stream.\n\nThis type allows the caller to manage inbound data [flow control]. The\ncaller is expected to call [`release_capacity`] after dropping data frames.\n\n# Overview\n\nEach stream has a window size. This window size is the maximum amount of\ninbound data that can be in-flight. In-flight data is defined as data that\nhas been received, but not yet released.\n\nWhen a stream is created, the window size is set to the connection's initial\nwindow size value. When a data frame is received, the window size is then\ndecremented by size of the data frame before the data is provided to the\ncaller. As the caller finishes using the data, [`release_capacity`] must be\ncalled. This will then increment the window size again, allowing the peer to\nsend more data.\n\nThere is also a connection level window as well as the stream level window.\nReceived data counts against the connection level window as well and calls\nto [`release_capacity`] will also increment the connection level window.\n\n# Sending `WINDOW_UPDATE` frames\n\n`WINDOW_UPDATE` frames will not be sent out for **every** call to\n`release_capacity`, as this would end up slowing down the protocol. Instead,\n`h2` waits until the window size is increased to a certain threshold and\nthen sends out a single `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame representing all the calls to\n`release_capacity` since the last `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame.\n\nThis essentially batches window updating.\n\n# Scenarios\n\nFollowing is a basic scenario with an HTTP/2 connection containing a\nsingle active stream.\n\n* A new stream is activated. The receive window is initialized to 1024 (the\n  value of the initial window size for this connection).\n* A `DATA` frame is received containing a payload of 600 bytes.\n* The receive window size is reduced to 424 bytes.\n* [`release_capacity`] is called with 200.\n* The receive window size is now 624 bytes. The peer may send no more than\n  this.\n* A `DATA` frame is received with a payload of 624 bytes.\n* The window size is now 0 bytes. The peer may not send any more data.\n* [`release_capacity`] is called with 1024.\n* The receive window size is now 1024 bytes.

asynchronous, HTTP/2 server and client implementation.\n\nThis library implements the [HTTP/2] specification. The implementation is\nasynchronous, using [futures] as the basis for the API. The implementation\nis also decoupled from TCP or TLS details. The user must handle ALPN and\nHTTP/1.1 upgrades themselves.\n\n# Getting started\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nh2 = \"0.3\"\n```\n\n# Layout\n\nThe crate is split into [`client`] and [`server`] modules. Types that are\ncommon to both clients and servers are located at the root of the crate.\n\nSee module level documentation for more details on how to use `h2`.\n\n# Handshake\n\nBoth the client and the server require a connection to already be in a state\nready to start the HTTP/2 handshake. This library does not provide\nfacilities to do this.\n\nThere are three ways to reach an appropriate state to start the HTTP/2\nhandshake.\n\n* Opening an HTTP/1.1 connection and performing an [upgrade].\n* Opening a connection with TLS and use ALPN to negotiate the protocol.\n* Open a connection with prior knowledge, i.e. both the client and the\n  server assume that the connection is immediately ready to start the\n  HTTP/2 handshake once opened.\n\nOnce the connection is ready to start the HTTP/2 handshake, it can be\npassed to [`server::handshake`] or [`client::handshake`]. At this point, the\nlibrary will start the handshake process, which consists of:\n\n* The client sends the connection preface (a predefined sequence of 24\noctets).\n* Both the client and the server sending a SETTINGS frame.\n\nSee the [Starting HTTP/2] in the specification for more details.\n\n# Flow control\n\n[Flow control] is a fundamental feature of HTTP/2. The `h2` library\nexposes flow control to the user.\n\nAn HTTP/2 client or server may not send unlimited data to the peer. When a\nstream is initiated, both the client and the server are provided with an\ninitial window size for that stream.  A window size is the number of bytes\nthe endpoint can send to the peer. At any point in time, the peer may\nincrease this window size by sending a `WINDOW_UPDATE` frame. Once a client\nor server has sent data filling the window for a stream, no further data may\nbe sent on that stream until the peer increases the window.\n\nThere is also a **connection level** window governing data sent across all\nstreams.\n\nManaging flow control for inbound data is done through [`FlowControl`].\nManaging flow control for outbound data is done through [`SendStream`]. See\nthe struct level documentation for those two types for more details.\n\n[HTTP/2]: https://http2.github.io/\n[futures]: https://docs.rs/futures/\n[`client`]: client/index.html\n[`server`]:

For example:\n\n```rust\n# use h2::*;\n# async fn doc(mut send_stream: SendStream<&'static [u8]>) {\nsend_stream.reserve_capacity(100);\n\nsend_stream.send_data(b\"hello\", false).unwrap();\n// At this point, the total amount of requested capacity is 95 bytes.\n\n// Calling `reserve_capacity` with `100` again essentially requests an\n// additional 5 bytes.\nsend_stream.reserve_capacity(100);\n# }\n```\n\nSee [Flow control](struct.SendStream.html#flow-control) for an overview\nof how send flow control works.","links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":true,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}],["capacity",{"kind":"primitive","inner":"usize"}]],"output":null,"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":[],"abi":"\"Rust\"","has_body":true}},"2:12438":{"id":"2:12438","crate_id":2,"name":"trim_end","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":"Returns a string slice with trailing whitespace removed.\n\n'Whitespace' is defined according to the terms of the Unicode Derived\nCore Property `White_Space`.\n\n# Text directionality\n\nA string is a sequence of bytes. `end` in this context means the last\nposition of that byte string; for a left-to-right language like English or\nRussian, this will be right side, and for right-to-left languages like\nArabic or Hebrew, this will be the left side.\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet s = \" Hello\\tworld\\t\";\nassert_eq!(\" Hello\\tworld\", s.trim_end());\n```\n\nDirectionality:\n\n```\nlet s = \"  English  \";\nassert!(Some('h') == s.trim_end().chars().rev().next());\n\nlet s = \"  עברית  \";\nassert!(Some('ת') == s.trim_end().chars().rev().next());\n```","links":{},"attrs":["#[inline]","#[must_use =\n  \"this returns the trimmed string as a new slice, \\\n                  without modifying the original\"]","#[stable(feature = \"trim_direction\", since = \"1.30.0\")]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}]],"output":{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":null,"mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"str"}}},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"header":[],"abi":"\"Rust\"","has_body":true}},"2:12378":{"id":"2:12378","crate_id":2,"name":"contains","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":"Returns `true` if the given pattern matches a sub-slice of\nthis string slice.\n\nReturns `false` if it does not.\n\nThe [pattern] can be a `&str`, [`char`], a slice of [`char`]s, or a\nfunction or closure that determines if a character matches.\n\n[`char`]: prim@char\n[pattern]: self::pattern\n\n# Examples\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```\nlet bananas = \"bananas\";\n\nassert!(bananas.contains(\"nana\"));\nassert!(!bananas.contains(\"apples\"));\n```","links":{"prim@char":"1:15264","self::pattern":"2:11984"},"attrs":["#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]","#[inline]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"method","inner":{"decl":{"inputs":[["self",{"kind":"borrowed_ref","inner":{"lifetime":"'a","mutable":false,"type":{"kind":"generic","inner":"Self"}}}],["pat",{"kind":"generic","inner":"P"}]],"output":{"kind":"primitive","inner":"bool"},"c_variadic":false},"generics":{"params":[{"name":"'a","kind":{"lifetime":{"outlives":[]}}},{"name":"P","kind":{"type":{"bounds":[],"default":null}}}],"where_predicates":[{"bound_predicate":{"ty":{"kind":"generic","inner":"P"},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Pattern","id":"2:11994","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[{"lifetime":"'a"}],"bindings":[]}},"param_names":[]}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}]}}]},"header":[],"abi":"\"Rust\"","has_body":true}},"33:543":{"id":"33:543","crate_id":33,"name":"AsHeaderName","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"trait","inner":{"is_auto":false,"is_unsafe":false,"items":[],"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"bounds":[{"trait_bound":{"trait":{"kind":"resolved_path","inner":{"name":"Sealed","id":"33:544","args":{"angle_bracketed":{"args":[],"bindings":[]}},"param_names":[]}},"generic_params":[],"modifier":"none"}}],"implementors":[]}},"2:12451":{"id":"2:12451","crate_id":2,"name":"strip_suffix","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":"Returns a string slice with the suffix removed.\n\nIf the string ends with the pattern `suffix`, returns the substring before the suffix,\nwrapped in `Some`.

See [here](../index.html#handshake) for more\ndetails.\n\nThis could be as basic as using Tokio's [`TcpListener`] to accept\nconnections, but usually it means using either ALPN or HTTP/1.1 protocol\nupgrades.\n\nOnce a connection is obtained, it is passed to [`handshake`],\nwhich will begin the [HTTP/2 handshake]. This returns a future that\ncompletes once the handshake process is performed and HTTP/2 streams may\nbe received.\n\n[`handshake`] uses default configuration values. There are a number of\nsettings that can be changed by using [`Builder`] instead.\n\n# Inbound streams\n\nThe [`Connection`] instance is used to accept inbound HTTP/2 streams. It\ndoes this by implementing [`futures::Stream`]. When a new stream is\nreceived, a call to [`Connection::accept`] will return `(request, response)`.\nThe `request` handle (of type [`http::Request<RecvStream>`]) contains the\nHTTP request head as well as provides a way to receive the inbound data\nstream and the trailers. The `response` handle (of type [`SendResponse`])\nallows responding to the request, stream the response payload, send\ntrailers, and send push promises.\n\nThe send ([`SendStream`]) and receive ([`RecvStream`]) halves of the stream\ncan be operated independently.\n\n# Managing the connection\n\nThe [`Connection`] instance is used to manage connection state. The caller\nis required to call either [`Connection::accept`] or\n[`Connection::poll_close`] in order to advance the connection state. Simply\noperating on [`SendStream`] or [`RecvStream`] will have no effect unless the\nconnection state is advanced.\n\nIt is not required to call **both** [`Connection::accept`] and\n[`Connection::poll_close`]. If the caller is ready to accept a new stream,\nthen only [`Connection::accept`] should be called. When the caller **does\nnot** want to accept a new stream, [`Connection::poll_close`] should be\ncalled.\n\nThe [`Connection`] instance should only be dropped once\n[`Connection::poll_close`] returns `Ready`. Once [`Connection::accept`]\nreturns `Ready(None)`, there will no longer be any more inbound streams. At\nthis point, only [`Connection::poll_close`] should be called.\n\n# Shutting down the server\n\nGraceful shutdown of the server is [not yet\nimplemented](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/issues/69).\n\n# Example\n\nA basic HTTP/2 server example that runs over TCP and assumes [prior\nknowledge], i.e. both the client and the server assume that the TCP socket\nwill use the HTTP/2 protocol without prior negotiation.\n\n```no_run\nuse h2::server;\nuse http::{Response, StatusCode};\nuse tokio::net::TcpListener;\n\n#[tokio::main]\npub async fn main() {\n    let mut listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:5928\").await.unwrap();\n\n    // Accept all incoming TCP connections.\n    loop {\n        if let Ok((socket, _peer_addr)) = listener.accept().await {\n            // Spawn a new task to process each connection.\n            tokio::spawn(async {\n                // Start the HTTP/2 connection handshake\n                let
