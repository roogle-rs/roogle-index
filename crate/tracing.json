Attributes describing spans\n include:\n\n - An [`Id`] assigned by the subscriber that uniquely identifies it in relation\n   to other spans.\n - The span's [parent] in the trace tree.\n - [Metadata] that describes static characteristics of all spans\n   originating from that callsite, such as its name, source code location,\n   [verbosity level], and the names of its fields.\n\n # Creating Spans\n\n Spans are created using the [`span!`] macro. This macro is invoked with the\n following arguments, in order:\n\n - The [`target`] and/or [`parent`][parent] attributes, if the user wishes to\n   override their default values.\n - The span's [verbosity level]\n - A string literal providing the span's name.\n - Finally, zero or more arbitrary key/value fields.\n\n [`target`]: super::Metadata::target\n\n For example:\n ```rust\n use tracing::{span, Level};\n\n /// Construct a new span at the `INFO` level named \"my_span\", with a single\n /// field named answer , with the value `42`.\n let my_span = span!(Level::INFO, \"my_span\", answer = 42);\n ```\n\n The documentation for the [`span!`] macro provides additional examples of\n the various options that exist when creating spans.\n\n The [`trace_span!`], [`debug_span!`], [`info_span!`], [`warn_span!`], and\n [`error_span!`] exist as shorthand for constructing spans at various\n verbosity levels.\n\n ## Recording Span Creation\n\n The [`Attributes`] type contains data associated with a span, and is\n provided to the [`Subscriber`] when a new span is created. It contains\n the span's metadata, the ID of [the span's parent][parent] if one was\n explicitly set, and any fields whose values were recorded when the span was\n constructed. The subscriber, which is responsible for recording `tracing`\n data, can then store or record these values.\n\n # The Span Lifecycle\n\n ## Entering a Span\n\n A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it begins executing,\n and _exit_ the span when it switches to another context. Spans may be\n entered through the [`enter`], [`entered`], and [`in_scope`] methods.\n\n The [`enter`] method enters a span, returning a [guard] that exits the span\n when dropped\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n let my_var: u64 = 5;\n let my_span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my_span\", my_var);\n\n // `my_span` exists but has not been entered.\n\n // Enter `my_span`...\n let _enter = my_span.enter();\n\n // Perform some work inside of the context of `my_span`...\n // Dropping the `_enter` guard will exit the span.\n```\n\n <div class=\"example-wrap\" style=\"display:inline-block\"><pre class=\"compile_fail\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n     <strong>Warning</strong>: In asynchronous code that uses async/await syntax,\n     <code>Span::enter</code> may produce incorrect traces if the returned drop\n     guard is held across an await point. See\n     <a href=\"struct.Span.html#in-asynchronous-code\">the method documentation</a>\n     for details.\n </pre></div>\n\n The [`entered`] method is analogous to [`enter`], but moves the span into\n the returned guard, rather than borrowing it. This allows creating and\n entering a span in a single expression:\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n // Create a span and enter it, returning a guard:\n let span = span!(Level::INFO, \"my_span\").entered();\n\n // We are now inside the span! Like `enter()`, the guard returned by\n // `entered()` will exit the span when it is dropped...\n\n // ...but, it can also be exited explicitly, returning the `Span`\n // struct:\n let span = span.exit();\n ```\n\n Finally, [`in_scope`] takes a closure or function pointer and executes it\n inside the span:\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n let my_var: u64 = 5;\n let my_span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my_span\", my_var = &my_var);\n\n my_span.in_scope(|| {\n     // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...\n });\n\n // Perform some work outside of the context of `my_span`...\n\n my_span.in_scope(|| {\n     // Perform some more work in the context of `my_span`.\n });\n ```\n\n <pre class=\"ignore\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n     <strong>Note</strong>: Since entering a span takes <code>&self</code>, and\n     <code>Span</code>s are <code>Clone</code>, <code>Send</code>, and\n     <code>Sync</code>, it is entirely valid for multiple threads to enter the\n     same span concurrently.\n </pre>\n\n ## Span Relationships\n\n Spans form a tree structure — unless it is a root span, all spans have a\n _parent_, and may have one or more _children_. When a new span is created,\n the current span becomes the new span's parent. The total execution time of\n a span consists of the time spent in that span and in the entire subtree\n represented by its children. Thus, a parent span always lasts for at least\n as long as the longest-executing span in its subtree.\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{Level, span};\n // this span is considered the \"root\" of a new trace tree:\n span!(Level::INFO, \"root\").in_scope(|| {\n     // since we are now inside \"root\", this span is considered a child\n     // of \"root\":\n     span!(Level::DEBUG, \"outer_child\").in_scope(|| {\n         // this span is a child of \"outer_child\", which is in turn a\n         // child of \"root\":\n         span!(Level::TRACE, \"inner_child\").in_scope(|| {\n             // and so on...\n         });\n     });\n     // another span created here would also be a child of \"root\".\n });\n```\n\n In addition, the parent of a span may be explicitly specified in\n the `span!` macro. For example:\n\n ```rust\n # use tracing::{Level, span};\n // Create, but do not enter, a span called \"foo\".\n let foo = span!(Level::INFO, \"foo\");\n\n // Create and enter a span called \"bar\".\n let bar = span!(Level::INFO, \"bar\");\n let _enter = bar.enter();\n\n // Although we have currently entered \"bar\", \"baz\"'s parent span\n // will be \"foo\".\n let baz = span!(parent: &foo, Level::INFO, \"baz\");\n ```\n\n A child span should typically be considered _part_ of its parent. For\n example, if a subscriber is recording the length of time spent in various\n spans, it should generally include the time spent in a span's children as\n part of that span's duration.\n\n In addition to having zero or one parent, a span may also _follow from_ any\n number of other spans. This indicates a causal relationship between the span\n and the spans that it follows from, but a follower is *not* typically\n considered part of the duration of the span it follows. Unlike the parent, a\n span may record that it follows from another span after it is created, using\n the [`follows_from`] method.\n\n As an example, consider a listener task in a server. As the listener accepts\n incoming connections, it spawns new tasks that handle those connections. We\n might want to have a span representing the listener, and instrument each\n spawned handler task with its own span. We would want our instrumentation to\n record that the handler tasks were spawned as a result of the listener task.\n However, we might not consider the handler tasks to be _part_ of the time\n spent in the listener task, so we would not consider those spans children of\n the listener span. Instead, we would record that the handler tasks follow\n from the listener, recording the causal relationship but treating the spans\n as separate durations.\n\n ## Closing Spans\n\n Execution may enter and exit a span multiple times before that span is\n _closed_. Consider, for example, a future which has an associated\n span and enters that span every time it is polled:\n ```rust\n # use std::future::Future;\n # use std::task::{Context, Poll};\n # use std::pin::Pin;\n struct MyFuture {\n    // data\n    span: tracing::Span,\n }\n\n impl Future for MyFuture {\n     type Output = ();\n\n     fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {\n         let _enter = self.span.enter();\n         // Do actual future work...\n # Poll::Ready(())\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n If this future was spawned on an executor, it might yield one or more times\n before `poll` returns [`Poll::Ready`]. If the future were to yield, then\n the executor would move on to poll the next future, which may _also_ enter\n an associated span or series of spans. Therefore, it is valid for a span to\n be entered repeatedly before it completes. Only the time when that span or\n one of its children was the current span is considered to be time spent in\n that span. A span which is not executing and has not yet been closed is said\n to be _idle_.\n\n Because spans may be entered and exited multiple times before they close,\n [`Subscriber`]s have separate trait methods which are called to notify them\n of span exits and when span handles are dropped. When execution exits a\n span, [`exit`] will always be called with that span's ID to notify the\n subscriber that the span has been exited. When span handles are dropped, the\n [`drop_span`] method is called with that span's ID. The subscriber may use\n this to determine whether or not the span will be entered again.\n\n If there is only a single handle with the capacity to exit a span, dropping\n that handle \"closes\" the span, since the capacity to enter it no longer\n exists. For example:\n ```\n # use tracing::{Level, span};\n {\n     span!(Level::TRACE, \"my_span\").in_scope(|| {\n         // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...\n     }); // --> Subscriber::exit(my_span)\n\n     // The handle to `my_span` only lives inside of this block; when it is\n     // dropped, the subscriber will be informed via `drop_span`.\n\n } // --> Subscriber::drop_span(my_span)\n ```\n\n However, if multiple handles exist, the span can still be re-entered even if\n one or more is dropped. For determining when _all_ handles to a span have\n been dropped, `Subscriber`s have a [`clone_span`] method, which is called\n every time a span handle is cloned. Combined with `drop_span`, this may be\n used to track the number of handles to a given span — if `drop_span` has\n been called one more time than the number of calls to `clone_span` for a\n given ID, then no more handles to the span with that ID exist. The\n subscriber may then treat it as closed.\n\n # When to use spans\n\n As a rule of thumb, spans should be used to represent discrete units of work\n (e.g., a given request's lifetime in a server) or periods of time spent in a\n given context (e.g., time spent interacting with an instance of an external\n system, such as a database).\n\n Which scopes in a program correspond to new spans depend somewhat on user\n intent. For example, consider the case of a loop in a program. Should we\n construct one span and perform the entire loop inside of that span, like:\n\n ```rust\n # use tracing::{Level, span};\n # let n = 1;\n let span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my_loop\");\n let _enter = span.enter();\n for i in 0..n {\n     # let _ = i;\n     // ...\n }\n ```\n Or, should we create a new span for each iteration of the loop, as in:\n ```rust\n # use tracing::{Level, span};\n # let n = 1u64;\n for i in 0..n {\n     let span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my_loop\", iteration = i);\n     let _enter = span.enter();\n     // ...\n }\n ```\n\n Depending on the circumstances, we might want to do either, or both. For\n example, if we want to know how long was spent in the loop overall, we would\n create a single span around the entire loop; whereas if we wanted to know how\n much time was spent in each individual iteration, we would enter a new span\n on every iteration.\n\n [fields]: super::field\n [Metadata]: super::Metadata\n [verbosity level]: super::Level\n [`Poll::Ready`]:

internally as an array index) to a [`Value`].\n\n# `Value`s and `Subscriber`s\n\n`Subscriber`s consume `Value`s as fields attached to [span]s or [`Event`]s.\nThe set of field keys on a given span or event is defined on its [`Metadata`].\nWhen a span is created, it provides [`Attributes`] to the `Subscriber`'s\n[`new_span`] method, containing any fields whose values were provided when\nthe span was created; and may call the `Subscriber`'s [`record`] method\nwith additional [`Record`]s if values are added for more of its fields.\nSimilarly, the [`Event`] type passed to the subscriber's [`event`] method\nwill contain any fields attached to each event.\n\n`tracing` represents values as either one of a set of Rust primitives\n(`i64`, `u64`, `f64`, `bool`, and `&str`) or using a `fmt::Display` or\n`fmt::Debug` implementation. `Subscriber`s are provided these primitive\nvalue types as `dyn Value` trait objects.\n\nThese trait objects can be formatted using `fmt::Debug`, but may also be\nrecorded as typed data by calling the [`Value::record`] method on these\ntrait objects with a _visitor_ implementing the [`Visit`] trait. This trait\nrepresents the behavior used to record values of various types. For example,\nan implementation of `Visit` might record integers by incrementing counters\nfor their field names rather than printing them.\n\n\n# Using `valuable`\n\n`tracing`'s [`Value`] trait is intentionally minimalist: it supports only a small\nnumber of Rust primitives as typed values, and only permits recording\nuser-defined types with their [`fmt::Debug`] or [`fmt::Display`]\nimplementations. However, there are some cases where it may be useful to record\nnested values (such as arrays, `Vec`s, or `HashMap`s containing values), or\nuser-defined `struct` and `enum` types without having to format them as\nunstructured text.\n\nTo address `Value`'s limitations, `tracing` offers experimental support for\nthe [`valuable`] crate, which provides object-safe inspection of structured\nvalues. User-defined types can implement the [`valuable::Valuable`] trait,\nand be recorded as a `tracing` field by calling their [`as_value`] method.\nIf the [`Subscriber`] also supports the `valuable` crate, it can\nthen visit those types fields as structured values using `valuable`.\n\n<pre class=\"ignore\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n    <strong>Note</strong>: <code>valuable</code> support is an\n    <a href = \"../index.html#unstable-features\">unstable feature</a>. See\n    the documentation on unstable features for details on how to enable it.\n</pre>\n\nFor example:\n```ignore\n// Derive `Valuable` for our types:\nuse valuable::Valuable;\n\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, Valuable)]\nstruct User {\n    name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    address: Address,\n}\n\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, Valuable)]\nstruct Address {\n    country: String,\n    city: String,\n    street: String,\n}\n\nlet user = User {\n    name: \"Arwen Undomiel\".to_string(),\n    age: 3000,\n    address: Address {\n        country: \"Middle Earth\".to_string(),\n        city: \"Rivendell\".to_string(),\n        street: \"leafy lane\".to_string(),\n    },\n};\n\n// Recording `user` as a `valuable::Value` will allow the `tracing` subscriber\n// to traverse its fields as a nested, typed structure:\ntracing::info!(current_user = user.as_value());\n```\n\nAlternatively, the [`valuable()`] function may be used to convert a type\nimplementing [`Valuable`] into a `tracing` field value.\n\nWhen the `valuable` feature is enabled, the [`Visit`] trait will include an\noptional [`record_value`] method. `Visit` implementations that wish to\nrecord `valuable` values can implement this method with custom behavior.\nIf a visitor does not implement `record_value`, the [`valuable::Value`] will\nbe forwarded to the visitor's [`record_debug`] method.\n\n[`fmt::Debug`]: std::fmt::Debug\n[`fmt::Display`]: std::fmt::Debug\n[`valuable`]: https://crates.io/crates/valuable\n[`valuable::Valuable`]: https://docs.rs/valuable/latest/valuable/trait.Valuable.html\n[`as_value`]: https://docs.rs/valuable/latest/valuable/trait.Valuable.html#tymethod.as_value\n[`valuable::Value`]: https://docs.rs/valuable/latest/valuable/enum.Value.html\n[`Subscriber`]: crate::Subscriber\n[`record_value`]: Visit::record_value\n[`record_debug`]: Visit::record_debug\n[span]: mod@crate::span\n[`Event`]: crate::event::Event\n[`Metadata`]: crate::Metadata\n[`Attributes`]: crate::span::Attributes\n[`Record`]: crate::span::Record\n[`new_span`]: crate::Subscriber::new_span\n[`record`]: crate::Subscriber::record\n[`event`]: crate::Subscriber::event","links":{"`Visit`":"20:278:2471","std::fmt::Debug":"2:9877:118","crate::Subscriber::new_span":"20:686:3491","crate::Subscriber":"20:681:2425","crate::event::Event":"20:827:2422","`Value`":"20:288:2423","Visit::record_debug":"20:287:2476","mod@crate::span":"0:141:2426","crate::span::Attributes":"20:1099:3429","`Value::record`":"20:289:2486","crate::span::Record":"20:1107:2464","crate::Metadata":"20:477:2432"},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"inner":{"module":{"is_crate":false,"items":["0:60:3006","0:58-20:259:710"],"is_stripped":false}}},"2:12769:29377":{"id":"2:12769:29377","crate_id":2,"name":"split_at","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":"Divide one string slice into two at an index.\n\nThe argument, `mid`, should be a byte offset from the start of the\nstring.

For example:\n\n```\n# use tracing::info_span;\nlet _span = info_span!(\"something_interesting\").entered();\n```\nrather than:\n```\n# use tracing::info_span;\nlet span = info_span!(\"something_interesting\");\nlet _e = span.enter();\n```\n\nFurthermore, `entered` may be used when the span must be stored in some\nother struct or be passed to a function while remaining entered.\n\n<pre class=\"ignore\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n    <strong>Note</strong>: The returned <a href=\"../struct.EnteredSpan.html\">\n    <code>EnteredSpan</code></a> guard does not implement <code>Send</code>.\n    Dropping the guard will exit <em>this</em> span, and if the guard is sent\n    to another thread and dropped there, that thread may never have entered\n    this span. Thus, <code>EnteredSpan</code>s should not be sent between threads.\n</pre>\n\n[syntax]: https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html\n\n# Examples\n\nThe returned guard can be [explicitly exited][EnteredSpan::exit],\nreturning the un-entered span:\n\n```\n# use tracing::{Level, span};\nlet span = span!(Level::INFO, \"doing_something\").entered();\n\n// code here is within the span\n\n// explicitly exit the span, returning it\nlet span = span.exit();\n\n// code here is no longer within the span\n\n// enter the span again\nlet span = span.entered();\n\n// now we are inside the span once again\n```\n\nGuards need not be explicitly dropped:\n\n```\n# use tracing::trace_span;\nfn my_function() -> String {\n    // enter a span for the duration of this function.\n    let span = trace_span!(\"my_function\").entered();\n\n    // anything happening in functions we call is still inside the span...\n    my_other_function();\n\n    // returning from the function drops the guard, exiting the span.\n    return \"Hello world\".to_owned();\n}\n\nfn my_other_function() {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nSince the [`EnteredSpan`] guard can dereference to the [`Span`] itself,\nthe span may still be accessed while entered. For example:\n\n```rust\n# use tracing::info_span;\nuse tracing::field;\n\n// create the span with an empty field, and enter it.\nlet span = info_span!(\"my_span\", some_field = field::Empty).entered();\n\n// we can still record a value for the field while the span is entered.\nspan.record(\"some_field\", &\"hello world!\");\n```\n\n[`Subscriber::enter`]:

this span, returning a guard that will exit the span when dropped.\n\nIf this span is enabled by the current subscriber, then this function will\ncall [`Subscriber::enter`] with the span's [`Id`], and dropping the guard\nwill call [`Subscriber::exit`]. If the span is disabled, this does\nnothing.\n\n# In Asynchronous Code\n\n**Warning**: in asynchronous code that uses [async/await syntax][syntax],\n`Span::enter` should be used very carefully or avoided entirely. Holding\nthe drop guard returned by `Span::enter` across `.await` points will\nresult in incorrect traces. For example,\n\n```\n# use tracing::info_span;\n# async fn some_other_async_function() {}\nasync fn my_async_function() {\n    let span = info_span!(\"my_async_function\");\n\n    // WARNING: This span will remain entered until this\n    // guard is dropped...\n    let _enter = span.enter();\n    // ...but the `await` keyword may yield, causing the\n    // runtime to switch to another task, while remaining in\n    // this span!\n    some_other_async_function().await\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe drop guard returned by `Span::enter` exits the span when it is\ndropped. When an async function or async block yields at an `.await`\npoint, the current scope is _exited_, but values in that scope are\n**not** dropped (because the async block will eventually resume\nexecution from that await point). This means that _another_ task will\nbegin executing while _remaining_ in the entered span. This results in\nan incorrect trace.\n\nInstead of using `Span::enter` in asynchronous code, prefer the\nfollowing:\n\n* To enter a span for a synchronous section of code within an async\n  block or function, prefer [`Span::in_scope`]. Since `in_scope` takes a\n  synchronous closure and exits the span when the closure returns, the\n  span will always be exited before the next await point. For example:\n  ```\n  # use tracing::info_span;\n  # async fn some_other_async_function(_: ()) {}\n  async fn my_async_function() {\n      let span = info_span!(\"my_async_function\");\n\n      let some_value = span.in_scope(|| {\n          // run some synchronous code inside the span...\n      });\n\n      // This is okay! The span has already been exited before we reach\n      // the await point.\n      some_other_async_function(some_value).await;\n\n      // ...\n  }\n  ```\n* For instrumenting asynchronous code, `tracing` provides the\n  [`Future::instrument` combinator][instrument] for\n  attaching a span to a future (async function or block). This will\n  enter the span _every_ time the future is polled, and exit it whenever\n  the future yields.\n\n  `Instrument` can be used with an async block inside an async function:\n  ```ignore\n  # use tracing::info_span;\n  use tracing::Instrument;\n\n  # async fn some_other_async_function() {}\n  async fn my_async_function() {\n      let span = info_span!(\"my_async_function\");\n      async move {\n         // This is correct! If we yield here, the span will be exited,\n         // and re-entered when we resume.\n         some_other_async_function().await;\n\n         //more asynchronous code inside the span...\n\n      }\n        // instrument the async block with the span...\n        .instrument(span)\n        // ...and await it.\n        .await\n  }\n  ```\n\n  It can also be used to instrument calls to async functions at the\n  callsite:\n  ```ignore\n  # use tracing::debug_span;\n  use tracing::Instrument;\n\n  # async fn some_other_async_function() {}\n  async fn my_async_function() {\n      let some_value = some_other_async_function()\n         .instrument(debug_span!(\"some_other_async_function\"))\n         .await;\n\n      // ...\n  }\n  ```\n\n* The [`#[instrument]` attribute macro][attr] can automatically generate\n  correct code when used on an async function:\n\n  ```ignore\n  # async fn some_other_async_function() {}\n  #[tracing::instrument(level = \"info\")]\n  async fn my_async_function() {\n\n      // This is correct! If we yield here, the span will be exited,\n      // and re-entered when we resume.\n      some_other_async_function().await;\n\n      // ...\n\n  }\n  ```\n\n[syntax]:

Overview\n\n `tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect\n structured, event-based diagnostic information.\n\n In asynchronous systems like Tokio, interpreting traditional log messages can\n often be quite challenging. Since individual tasks are multiplexed on the same\n thread, associated events and log lines are intermixed making it difficult to\n trace the logic flow. `tracing` expands upon logging-style diagnostics by\n allowing libraries and applications to record structured events with additional\n information about *temporality* and *causality* — unlike a log message, a span\n in `tracing` has a beginning and end time, may be entered and exited by the\n flow of execution, and may exist within a nested tree of similar spans. In\n addition, `tracing` spans are *structured*, with the ability to record typed\n data as well as textual messages.\n\n The `tracing` crate provides the APIs necessary for instrumenting libraries\n and applications to emit trace data.\n\n *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.56+][msrv]*\n\n [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions\n # Core Concepts\n\n The core of `tracing`'s API is composed of _spans_, _events_ and\n _subscribers_. We'll cover these in turn.\n\n ## Spans\n\n To record the flow of execution through a program, `tracing` introduces the\n concept of [spans]. Unlike a log line that represents a _moment in\n time_, a span represents a _period of time_ with a beginning and an end. When a\n program begins executing in a context or performing a unit of work, it\n _enters_ that context's span, and when it stops executing in that context,\n it _exits_ the span. The span in which a thread is currently executing is\n referred to as that thread's _current_ span.\n\n For example:\n ```\n use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n let span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my_span\");\n // `enter` returns a RAII guard which, when dropped, exits the span. this\n // indicates that we are in the span for the current lexical scope.\n let _enter = span.enter();\n // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...\n # }\n```\n\n The [`span` module][span]'s documentation provides further details on how to\n use spans.\n\n <div class=\"example-wrap\" style=\"display:inline-block\"><pre class=\"compile_fail\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n\n  **Warning**: In asynchronous code that uses async/await syntax,\n  `Span::enter` may produce incorrect traces if the returned drop\n  guard is held across an await point. See\n  [the method documentation][Span#in-asynchronous-code] for details.\n\n </pre></div>\n\n ## Events\n\n An [`Event`] represents a _moment_ in time. It signifies something that\n happened while a trace was being recorded. `Event`s are comparable to the log\n records emitted by unstructured logging code, but unlike a typical log line,\n an `Event` may occur within the context of a span.\n\n For example:\n ```\n use tracing::{event, span, Level};\n\n # fn main() {\n // records an event outside of any span context:\n event!(Level::INFO, \"something happened\");\n\n let span = span!(Level::INFO, \"my_span\");\n let _guard = span.enter();\n\n // records an event within \"my_span\".\n event!(Level::DEBUG, \"something happened inside my_span\");\n # }\n```\n\n In general, events should be used to represent points in time _within_ a\n span — a request returned with a given status code, _n_ new items were\n taken from a queue, and so on.\n\n The [`Event` struct][`Event`] documentation provides further details on using\n events.\n\n ## Subscribers\n\n As `Span`s and `Event`s occur, they are recorded or aggregated by\n implementations of the [`Subscriber`] trait. `Subscriber`s are notified\n when an `Event` takes place and when a `Span` is entered or exited. These\n notifications are represented by the following `Subscriber` trait methods:\n\n + [`event`][Subscriber::event], called when an `Event` takes place,\n + [`enter`], called when execution enters a `Span`,\n + [`exit`], called when execution exits a `Span`\n\n In addition, subscribers may implement the [`enabled`] function to _filter_\n the notifications they receive based on [metadata] describing each `Span`\n or `Event`. If a call to `Subscriber::enabled` returns `false` for a given\n set of metadata, that `Subscriber` will *not* be notified about the\n corresponding `Span` or `Event`. For performance reasons, if no currently\n active subscribers express interest in a given set of metadata by returning\n `true`, then the corresponding `Span` or `Event` will never be constructed.\n\n # Usage\n\n First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n ```toml\n [dependencies]\n tracing = \"0.1\"\n ```\n\n ## Recording Spans and Events\n\n Spans and events are recorded using macros.\n\n ### Spans\n\n The [`span!`] macro expands to a [`Span` struct][`Span`] which is used to\n record a span. The [`Span::enter`] method on that struct records that the\n span has been entered, and returns a [RAII] guard object, which will exit\n the span when dropped.\n\n For example:\n\n ```rust\n use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n // Construct a new span named \"my span\" with trace log level.\n let span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my span\");\n\n // Enter the span, returning a guard object.\n let _enter = span.enter();\n\n // Any trace events that occur before the guard is dropped will occur\n // within the span.\n\n // Dropping the guard will exit the span.\n # }\n ```\n\n The [`#[instrument]`][instrument] attribute provides an easy way to\n add `tracing` spans to functions. A function annotated with `#[instrument]`\n will create and enter a span with that function's name every time the\n function is called, with arguments to that function will be recorded as\n fields using `fmt::Debug`.\n\n For example:\n ```ignore\n # // this doctest is ignored because we don't have a way to say\n # // that it should only be run with cfg(feature = \"attributes\")\n use tracing::{Level, event, instrument};\n\n #[instrument]\n pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {\n     // This event will be recorded inside a span named `my_function` with the\n     // field `my_arg`.\n     event!(Level::INFO, \"inside my_function!\");\n     // ...\n }\n # fn main() {}\n ```\n\n For functions which don't have built-in tracing support and can't have\n the `#[instrument]` attribute applied (such as from an external crate),\n the [`Span` struct][`Span`] has a [`in_scope()` method][`in_scope`]\n which can be used to easily wrap synchonous code in a span.\n\n For example:\n ```rust\n use tracing::info_span;\n\n # fn doc() -> Result<(), ()> {\n # mod serde_json {\n #    pub(crate) fn from_slice(buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), ()> { Ok(()) }\n # }\n # let buf: [u8; 0] = [];\n let json = info_span!(\"json.parse\").in_scope(|| serde_json::from_slice(&buf))?;\n # let _ = json; // suppress unused variable warning\n # Ok(())\n # }\n ```\n\n You can find more examples showing how to use this crate [here][examples].\n\n [RAII]: https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns/blob/main/src/patterns/behavioural/RAII.md\n [examples]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing/tree/master/examples\n\n ### Events\n\n [`Event`]s are recorded using the [`event!`] macro:\n\n ```rust\n # fn main() {\n use tracing::{event, Level};\n event!(Level::INFO, \"something has happened!\");\n # }\n ```\n\n ## Using the Macros\n\n The [`span!`] and [`event!`] macros as well as the `#[instrument]` attribute\n use fairly similar syntax, with some exceptions.\n\n ### Configuring Attributes\n\n Both macros require a [`Level`] specifying the verbosity of the span or\n event. Optionally, the, [target] and [parent span] may be overridden. If the\n target and parent span are not overridden, they will default to the\n module path where the macro was invoked and the current span (as determined\n by the subscriber), respectively.\n\n For example:\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n span!(target: \"app_spans\", Level::TRACE, \"my span\");\n event!(target: \"app_events\", Level::INFO, \"something has happened!\");\n # }\n ```\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n let span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"my span\");\n event!(parent: &span, Level::INFO, \"something has happened!\");\n # }\n ```\n\n The span macros also take a string literal after the level, to set the name\n of the span (as above).  In the case of the event macros, the name of the event can\n be overridden (the default is `event file:line`) using the `name:` specifier.\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"my span\");\n event!(name: \"some_info\", Level::INFO, \"something has happened!\");\n # }\n ```\n\n ### Recording Fields\n\n Structured fields on spans and events are specified using the syntax\n `field_name = field_value`. Fields are separated by commas.\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n // records an event with two fields:\n //  - \"answer\", with the value 42\n //  - \"question\", with the value \"life, the universe and everything\"\n event!(Level::INFO, answer = 42, question = \"life, the universe, and everything\");\n # }\n ```\n\n As shorthand, local variables may be used as field values without an\n assignment, similar to [struct initializers]. For example:\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n let user = \"ferris\";\n\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"login\", user);\n // is equivalent to:\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"login\", user = user);\n # }\n```\n\n Field names can include dots, but should not be terminated by them:\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n let user = \"ferris\";\n let email = \"ferris@rust-lang.org\";\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"login\", user, user.email = email);\n # }\n```\n\n Since field names can include dots, fields on local structs can be used\n using the local variable shorthand:\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n # struct User {\n #    name: &'static str,\n #    email: &'static str,\n # }\n let user = User {\n     name: \"ferris\",\n     email: \"ferris@rust-lang.org\",\n };\n // the span will have the fields `user.name = \"ferris\"` and\n // `user.email = \"ferris@rust-lang.org\"`.\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"login\", user.name, user.email);\n # }\n```\n\n Fields with names that are not Rust identifiers, or with names that are Rust reserved words,\n may be created using quoted string literals. However, this may not be used with the local\n variable shorthand.\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n // records an event with fields whose names are not Rust identifiers\n //  - \"guid:x-request-id\", containing a `:`, with the value \"abcdef\"\n //  - \"type\", which is a reserved word, with the value \"request\"\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"api\", \"guid:x-request-id\" = \"abcdef\", \"type\" = \"request\");\n # }\n```\n\n Constant expressions can also be used as field names. Constants\n must be enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) to indicate that the *value*\n of the constant is to be used as the field name, rather than the\n constant's name. For example:\n ```\n # use tracing::{span, Level};\n # fn main() {\n const RESOURCE_NAME: &str = \"foo\";\n // this span will have the field `foo = \"some_id\"`\n span!(Level::TRACE, \"get\", { RESOURCE_NAME } = \"some_id\");\n # }\n```\n\n The `?` sigil is shorthand that specifies a field should be recorded using\n its [`fmt::Debug`] implementation:\n ```\n # use tracing::{event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n #[derive(Debug)]\n struct MyStruct {\n     field: &'static str,\n }\n\n let my_struct = MyStruct {\n     field: \"Hello world!\"\n };\n\n // `my_struct` will be recorded using its `fmt::Debug` implementation.\n event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = ?my_struct);\n // is equivalent to:\n event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = tracing::field::debug(&my_struct));\n # }\n ```\n\n The `%` sigil operates similarly, but indicates that the value should be\n recorded using its [`fmt::Display`] implementation:\n ```\n # use tracing::{event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n # #[derive(Debug)]\n # struct MyStruct {\n #     field: &'static str,\n # }\n #\n # let my_struct = MyStruct {\n #     field: \"Hello world!\"\n # };\n // `my_struct.field` will be recorded using its `fmt::Display` implementation.\n event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = %my_struct.field);\n // is equivalent to:\n event!(Level::TRACE, greeting = tracing::field::display(&my_struct.field));\n # }\n ```\n\n The `%` and `?` sigils may also be used with local variable shorthand:\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n # #[derive(Debug)]\n # struct MyStruct {\n #     field: &'static str,\n # }\n #\n # let my_struct = MyStruct {\n #     field: \"Hello world!\"\n # };\n // `my_struct.field` will be recorded using its `fmt::Display` implementation.\n event!(Level::TRACE, %my_struct.field);\n # }\n ```\n\n Additionally, a span may declare fields with the special value [`Empty`],\n which indicates that that the value for that field does not currently exist\n but may be recorded later. For example:\n\n ```\n use tracing::{trace_span, field};\n\n // Create a span with two fields: `greeting`, with the value \"hello world\", and\n // `parting`, without a value.\n let span = trace_span!(\"my_span\", greeting = \"hello world\", parting = field::Empty);\n\n // ...\n\n // Now, record a value for parting as well.\n span.record(\"parting\", &\"goodbye world!\");\n ```\n\n Finally, events may also include human-readable messages, in the form of a\n [format string][fmt] and (optional) arguments, **after** the event's\n key-value fields. If a format string and arguments are provided,\n they will implicitly create a new field named `message` whose value is the\n provided set of format arguments.\n\n For example:\n\n ```\n # use tracing::{event, Level};\n # fn main() {\n let question = \"the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything\";\n let answer = 42;\n // records an event with the following fields:\n // - `question.answer` with the value 42,\n // - `question.tricky` with the value `true`,\n // - \"message\", with the value \"the answer to the ultimate question of life, the\n //    universe, and everything is 42.\"\n event!(\n     Level::DEBUG,\n     question.answer = answer,\n     question.tricky = true,\n     \"the answer to {} is {}.\", question, answer\n );\n # }\n ```\n\n Specifying a formatted message in this manner does not allocate by default.\n\n [struct initializers]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-the-field-init-shorthand-when-variables-and-fields-have-the-same-name\n [target]: Metadata::target\n [parent span]: span::Attributes::parent\n [determined contextually]: span::Attributes::is_contextual\n [`fmt::Debug`]: std::fmt::Debug\n [`fmt::Display`]: std::fmt::Display\n [fmt]: std::fmt#usage\n [`Empty`]: field::Empty\n\n ### Shorthand Macros\n\n `tracing` also offers a number of macros with preset verbosity levels.\n The [`trace!`], [`debug!`], [`info!`], [`warn!`], and [`error!`] behave\n similarly to the [`event!`] macro, but with the [`Level`] argument already\n specified, while the corresponding [`trace_span!`], [`debug_span!`],\n [`info_span!`], [`warn_span!`], and [`error_span!`] macros are the same,\n but for the [`span!`] macro.\n\n These are intended both as a shorthand, and for compatibility with the [`log`]\n crate (see the next section).\n\n [`span!`]: span!\n [`event!`]: event!\n [`trace!`]: trace!\n [`debug!`]: debug!\n [`info!`]: info!\n [`warn!`]: warn!\n [`error!`]: error!\n [`trace_span!`]: trace_span!\n [`debug_span!`]: debug_span!\n [`info_span!`]: info_span!\n [`warn_span!`]: warn_span!\n [`error_span!`]: error_span!\n\n ### For `log` Users\n\n Users of the [`log`] crate should note that `tracing` exposes a set of\n macros for creating `Event`s (`trace!`, `debug!`, `info!`, `warn!`, and\n `error!`) which may be invoked with the same syntax as the similarly-named\n macros from the `log` crate. Often, the process of converting a project to\n use `tracing` can begin with a simple drop-in replacement.\n\n Let's consider the `log` crate's yak-shaving example:\n\n ```rust,ignore\n use std::{error::Error, io};\n use tracing::{debug, error, info, span, warn, Level};\n\n // the `#[tracing::instrument]` attribute creates and enters a span\n // every time the instrumented function is called. The span is named after the\n // the function or method. Parameters passed to the function are recorded as fields.\n #[tracing::instrument]\n pub fn shave(yak: usize) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error + 'static>> {\n     // this creates an event at the DEBUG level with two fields:\n     // - `excitement`, with the key \"excitement\" and the value \"yay!\"\n     // - `message`, with the key \"message\" and the value \"hello! I'm gonna shave a yak.\"\n     //\n     // unlike other fields, `message`'s shorthand initialization is just the string itself.\n     debug!(excitement = \"yay!\", \"hello! I'm gonna shave a yak.\");\n     if yak == 3 {\n         warn!(\"could not locate yak!\");\n         // note that this is intended to demonstrate `tracing`'s features, not idiomatic\n         // error handling! in a library or application, you should consider returning\n         // a dedicated `YakError`. libraries like snafu or thiserror make this easy.\n         return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, \"shaving yak failed!\").into());\n     } else {\n         debug!(\"yak shaved successfully\");\n     }\n     Ok(())\n }\n\n pub fn shave_all(yaks: usize) -> usize {\n     // Constructs a new span named \"shaving_yaks\" at the TRACE level,\n     // and a field whose key is \"yaks\". This is equivalent to writing:\n     //\n     // let span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"shaving_yaks\", yaks = yaks);\n     //\n     // local variables (`yaks`) can be used as field values\n     // without an assignment, similar to struct initializers.\n     let _span = span!(Level::TRACE, \"shaving_yaks\", yaks).entered();\n\n     info!(\"shaving yaks\");\n\n     let mut yaks_shaved = 0;\n     for yak in 1..=yaks {\n         let res = shave(yak);\n         debug!(yak, shaved = res.is_ok());\n\n         if let Err(ref error) = res {\n             // Like spans, events can also use the field initialization shorthand.\n             // In this instance, `yak` is the field being initalized.\n             error!(yak, error = error.as_ref(), \"failed to shave yak!\");\n         } else {\n             yaks_shaved += 1;\n         }\n         debug!(yaks_shaved);\n     }\n\n     yaks_shaved\n }\n ```\n\n ## In libraries\n\n Libraries should link only to the `tracing` crate, and use the provided\n macros to record whatever information will be useful to downstream\n consumers.\n\n ## In executables\n\n In order to record trace events, executables have to use a `Subscriber`\n implementation compatible with `tracing`. A `Subscriber` implements a\n way of collecting trace data, such as by logging it to standard output.\n\n This library does not contain any `Subscriber` implementations; these are\n provided by [other crates](#related-crates).\n\n The simplest way to use a subscriber is to call the [`set_global_default`]\n function:\n\n ```\n extern crate tracing;\n # pub struct FooSubscriber;\n # use tracing::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata};\n # impl tracing::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {\n #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }\n #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}\n #   fn event(&self, _: &tracing::Event) {}\n #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}\n #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }\n #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}\n #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}\n # }\n # impl FooSubscriber {\n #   fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber }\n # }\n # fn main() {\n\n let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();\n tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(my_subscriber)\n     .expect(\"setting tracing default failed\");\n # }\n ```\n\n <pre class=\"compile_fail\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n     <strong>Warning</strong>: In general, libraries should <em>not</em> call\n     <code>set_global_default()</code>! Doing so will cause conflicts when\n     executables that depend on the library try to set the default later.\n </pre>\n\n This subscriber will be used as the default in all threads for the\n remainder of the duration of the program, similar to setting the logger\n in the `log` crate.\n\n In addition, the default subscriber can be set through using the\n [`with_default`] function. This follows the `tokio` pattern of using\n closures to represent executing code in a context that is exited at the end\n of the closure. For example:\n\n ```rust\n # pub struct FooSubscriber;\n # use tracing::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata};\n # impl tracing::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {\n #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }\n #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}\n #   fn event(&self, _: &tracing::Event) {}\n #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}\n #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }\n #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}\n #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}\n # }\n # impl FooSubscriber {\n #   fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber }\n # }\n # fn main() {\n\n let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();\n # #[cfg(feature = \"std\")]\n tracing::subscriber::with_default(my_subscriber, || {\n     // Any trace events generated in this closure or by functions it calls\n     // will be collected by `my_subscriber`.\n })\n # }\n ```\n\n This approach allows trace data to be collected by multiple subscribers\n within different contexts in the program. Note that the override only applies to the\n currently executing thread; other threads will not see the change from with_default.\n\n Any trace events generated outside the context of a subscriber will not be collected.\n\n Once a subscriber has been set, instrumentation points may be added to the\n executable using the `tracing` crate's macros.\n\n ## `log` Compatibility\n\n The [`log`] crate provides a simple, lightweight logging facade for Rust.\n While `tracing` builds upon `log`'s foundation with richer structured\n diagnostic data, `log`'s simplicity and ubiquity make it the \"lowest common\n denominator\" for text-based logging in Rust — a vast majority of Rust\n libraries and applications either emit or consume `log` records. Therefore,\n `tracing` provides multiple forms of interoperability with `log`: `tracing`\n instrumentation can emit `log` records, and a compatibility layer enables\n `tracing` [`Subscriber`]s to consume `log` records as `tracing` [`Event`]s.\n\n ### Emitting `log` Records\n\n This crate provides two feature flags, \"log\" and \"log-always\", which will\n cause [spans] and [events] to emit `log` records. When the \"log\" feature is\n enabled, if no `tracing` `Subscriber` is active, invoking an event macro or\n creating a span with fields will emit a `log` record. This is intended\n primarily for use in libraries which wish to emit diagnostics that can be\n consumed by applications using `tracing` *or* `log`, without paying the\n additional overhead of emitting both forms of diagnostics when `tracing` is\n in use.\n\n Enabling the \"log-always\" feature will cause `log` records to be emitted\n even if a `tracing` `Subscriber` _is_ set. This is intended to be used in\n applications where a `log` `Logger` is being used to record a textual log,\n and `tracing` is used only to record other forms of diagnostics (such as\n metrics, profiling, or distributed tracing data). Unlike the \"log\" feature,\n libraries generally should **not** enable the \"log-always\" feature, as doing\n so will prevent applications from being able to opt out of the `log` records.\n\n See [here][flags] for more details on this crate's feature flags.\n\n The generated `log` records' messages will be a string representation of the\n span or event's fields, and all additional information recorded by `log`\n (target, verbosity level, module path, file, and line number) will also be\n populated. Additionally, `log` records are also generated when spans are\n entered, exited, and closed. Since these additional span lifecycle logs have\n the potential to be very verbose, and don't include additional fields, they\n will always be emitted at the `Trace` level, rather than inheriting the\n level of the span that generated them. Furthermore, they are are categorized\n under a separate `log` target, \"tracing::span\" (and its sub-target,\n \"tracing::span::active\", for the logs on entering and exiting a span), which\n may be enabled or disabled separately from other `log` records emitted by\n `tracing`.\n\n ### Consuming `log` Records\n\n The [`tracing-log`] crate provides a compatibility layer which\n allows a `tracing` [`Subscriber`] to consume `log` records as though they\n were `tracing` [events]. This allows applications using `tracing` to record\n the logs emitted by dependencies using `log` as events within the context of\n the application's trace tree. See [that crate's documentation][log-tracer]\n for details.\n\n [log-tracer]: https://docs.rs/tracing-log/latest/tracing_log/#convert-log-records-to-tracing-events\n\n ## Related Crates\n\n In addition to `tracing` and `tracing-core`, the [`tokio-rs/tracing`] repository\n contains several additional crates designed to be used with the `tracing` ecosystem.\n This includes a collection of `Subscriber` implementations, as well as utility\n and adapter crates to assist in writing `Subscriber`s and instrumenting\n applications.\n\n In particular, the following crates are likely to be of interest:\n\n  - [`tracing-futures`] provides a compatibility layer with the `futures`\n    crate, allowing spans to be attached to `Future`s, `Stream`s, and `Executor`s.\n  - [`tracing-subscriber`] provides `Subscriber` implementations and\n    utilities for working with `Subscriber`s. This includes a [`FmtSubscriber`]\n    `FmtSubscriber` for logging formatted trace data to stdout, with similar\n    filtering and formatting to the [`env_logger`] crate.\n  - [`tracing-log`] provides a compatibility layer with the [`log`] crate,\n    allowing log messages to be recorded as `tracing` `Event`s within the\n    trace tree. This is useful when a project using `tracing` have\n    dependencies which use `log`. Note that if you're using\n    `tracing-subscriber`'s `FmtSubscriber`, you don't need to depend on\n    `tracing-log` directly.\n  - [`tracing-appender`] provides utilities for outputting tracing data,\n     including a file appender and non blocking writer.\n\n Additionally, there are also several third-party crates which are not\n maintained by the `tokio` project. These include:\n\n  - [`tracing-timing`] implements inter-event timing metrics on top of `tracing`.\n    It provides a subscriber that records the time elapsed between pairs of\n    `tracing` events and generates histograms.\n  - [`tracing-opentelemetry`] provides a subscriber for emitting traces to\n    [OpenTelemetry]-compatible distributed tracing systems.\n  - [`tracing-honeycomb`] Provides a layer that reports traces spanning multiple machines to [honeycomb.io].

They may be less stable\n     than <code>tracing</code> and <code>tracing-core</code>.\n </pre>\n\n ## Crate Feature Flags\n\n The following crate [feature flags] are available:\n\n * A set of features controlling the [static verbosity level].\n * `log`: causes trace instrumentation points to emit [`log`] records as well\n   as trace events, if a default `tracing` subscriber has not been set. This\n   is intended for use in libraries whose users may be using either `tracing`\n   or `log`.\n * `log-always`: Emit `log` records from all `tracing` spans and events, even\n   if a `tracing` subscriber has been set. This should be set only by\n   applications which intend to collect traces and logs separately; if an\n   adapter is used to convert `log` records into `tracing` events, this will\n   cause duplicate events to occur.\n * `attributes`: Includes support for the `#[instrument]` attribute.\n   This is on by default, but does bring in the `syn` crate as a dependency,\n   which may add to the compile time of crates that do not already use it.\n * `std`: Depend on the Rust standard library (enabled by default).\n\n   `no_std` users may disable this feature with `default-features = false`:\n\n   ```toml\n   [dependencies]\n   tracing = { version = \"0.1.38\", default-features = false }\n   ```\n\n <pre class=\"ignore\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n     <strong>Note</strong>: <code>tracing</code>'s <code>no_std</code> support\n     requires <code>liballoc</code>.\n </pre>\n\n ### Unstable Features\n\n These feature flags enable **unstable** features. The public API may break in 0.1.x\n releases. To enable these features, the `--cfg tracing_unstable` must be passed to\n `rustc` when compiling.\n\n The following unstable feature flags are currently available:\n\n * `valuable`: Enables support for recording [field values] using the\n   [`valuable`] crate.\n\n #### Enabling Unstable Features\n\n The easiest way to set the `tracing_unstable` cfg is to use the `RUSTFLAGS`\n env variable when running `cargo` commands:\n\n ```shell\n RUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg tracing_unstable\" cargo build\n ```\n Alternatively, the following can be added to the `.cargo/config` file in a\n project to automatically enable the cfg flag for that project:\n\n ```toml\n [build]\n rustflags = [\"--cfg\", \"tracing_unstable\"]\n ```\n\n [feature flags]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-section\n [field values]: crate::field\n [`valuable`]: https://crates.io/crates/valuable\n\n ## Supported Rust Versions\n\n Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported\n version is 1.56. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on\n Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.\n\n Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio\n project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor\n versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current\n stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be\n increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum\n supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as\n long as doing so complies with this policy.\n\n [`log`]: https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/\n [span]:

When\nevents occur, or spans are created, they are dispatched to the thread's\ncurrent subscriber.\n\n## Setting the Default Subscriber\n\nBy default, the current subscriber is an empty implementation that does\nnothing. To use a subscriber implementation, it must be set as the default.\nThere are two methods for doing so: [`with_default`] and\n[`set_global_default`]. `with_default` sets the default subscriber for the\nduration of a scope, while `set_global_default` sets a default subscriber\nfor the entire process.\n\nTo use either of these functions, we must first wrap our subscriber in a\n[`Dispatch`], a cloneable, type-erased reference to a subscriber. For\nexample:\n```rust\n# pub struct FooSubscriber;\n# use tracing_core::{\n#   dispatcher, Event, Metadata,\n#   span::{Attributes, Id, Record}\n# };\n# impl tracing_core::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {\n#   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }\n#   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}\n#   fn event(&self, _: &Event) {}\n#   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}\n#   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }\n#   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}\n#   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}\n# }\n# impl FooSubscriber { fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber } }\nuse dispatcher::Dispatch;\n\nlet my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();\nlet my_dispatch = Dispatch::new(my_subscriber);\n```\nThen, we can use [`with_default`] to set our `Dispatch` as the default for\nthe duration of a block:\n```rust\n# pub struct FooSubscriber;\n# use tracing_core::{\n#   dispatcher, Event, Metadata,\n#   span::{Attributes, Id, Record}\n# };\n# impl tracing_core::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {\n#   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }\n#   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}\n#   fn event(&self, _: &Event) {}\n#   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}\n#   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }\n#   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}\n#   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}\n# }\n# impl FooSubscriber { fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber } }\n# let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();\n# let my_dispatch = dispatcher::Dispatch::new(my_subscriber);\n// no default subscriber\n\n# #[cfg(feature = \"std\")]\ndispatcher::with_default(&my_dispatch, || {\n    // my_subscriber is the default\n});\n\n// no default subscriber again\n```\nIt's important to note that `with_default` will not propagate the current\nthread's default subscriber to any threads spawned within the `with_default`\nblock. To propagate the default subscriber to new threads, either use\n`with_default` from the new thread, or use `set_global_default`.\n\nAs an alternative to `with_default`, we can use [`set_global_default`] to\nset a `Dispatch` as the default for all threads, for the lifetime of the\nprogram. For example:\n```rust\n# pub struct FooSubscriber;\n# use tracing_core::{\n#   dispatcher, Event, Metadata,\n#   span::{Attributes, Id, Record}\n# };\n# impl tracing_core::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {\n#   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }\n#   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}\n#   fn event(&self, _: &Event) {}\n#   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}\n#   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }\n#   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}\n#   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}\n# }\n# impl FooSubscriber { fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber } }\n# let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();\n# let my_dispatch = dispatcher::Dispatch::new(my_subscriber);\n// no default subscriber\n\ndispatcher::set_global_default(my_dispatch)\n    // `set_global_default` will return an error if the global default\n    // subscriber has already been set.\n    .expect(\"global default was already set!\");\n\n// `my_subscriber` is now the default\n```\n\n<pre class=\"ignore\" style=\"white-space:normal;font:inherit;\">\n<strong>Note</strong>: The thread-local scoped dispatcher (<code>with_default</code>)\nrequires the Rust standard library. <code>no_std</code> users should\nuse <a href=\"fn.set_global_default.html\"><code>set_global_default</code></a>\ninstead.\n</pre>\n\n## Accessing the Default Subscriber\n\nA thread's current default subscriber can be accessed using the\n[`get_default`] function, which executes a closure with a reference to the\ncurrently default `Dispatch`.

Consider the following:\n\n```\nlet _parent_span = tracing::info_span!(\"parent\").entered();\n\n// ...\n\nlet child_span = tracing::debug_span!(\"child\");\n\nstd::thread::spawn(move || {\n    let _entered = child_span.entered();\n\n    tracing::info!(\"spawned a thread!\");\n\n    // ...\n});\n```\n\nIf the current [`Subscriber`] enables the [`DEBUG`] level, then both\nthe \"parent\" and \"child\" spans will be enabled. Thus, when the \"spawaned\na thread!\" event occurs, it will be inside of the \"child\" span. Because\n\"parent\" is the parent of \"child\", the event will _also_ be inside of\n\"parent\".\n\nHowever, if the [`Subscriber`] only enables the [`INFO`] level, the \"child\"\nspan will be disabled. When the thread is spawned, the\n`child_span.entered()` call will do nothing, since \"child\" is not\nenabled. In this case, the \"spawned a thread!\" event occurs outside of\n*any* span, since the \"child\" span was responsible for propagating its\nparent to the spawned thread.\n\nIf this is not the desired behavior, `Span::or_current` can be used to\nensure that the \"parent\" span is propagated in both cases, either as a\nparent of \"child\" _or_ directly. For example:\n\n```\nlet _parent_span = tracing::info_span!(\"parent\").entered();\n\n// ...\n\n// If DEBUG is enabled, then \"child\" will be enabled, and `or_current`\n// returns \"child\". Otherwise, if DEBUG is not enabled, \"child\" will be\n// disabled, and `or_current` returns \"parent\".\nlet child_span = tracing::debug_span!(\"child\").or_current();\n\nstd::thread::spawn(move || {\n    let _entered = child_span.entered();\n\n    tracing::info!(\"spawned a thread!\");\n\n    // ...\n});\n```\n\nWhen spawning [asynchronous tasks][async tasks], `Span::or_current` can\nbe used similarly, in combination with [`instrument`]:\n\n```\nuse tracing::Instrument;\n# // lol\n# mod tokio {\n#     pub(super) fn spawn(_: impl std::future::Future) {}\n# }\n\nlet _parent_span = tracing::info_span!(\"parent\").entered();\n\n// ...\n\nlet child_span = tracing::debug_span!(\"child\");\n\ntokio::spawn(\n    async {\n        tracing::info!(\"spawned a task!\");\n\n        // ...\n\n    }.instrument(child_span.or_current())\n);\n```\n\nIn general, `or_current` should be preferred over nesting an\n[`instrument`]  call inside of an [`in_current_span`] call, as using\n`or_current` will be more efficient.\n\n```\nuse tracing::Instrument;\n# // lol\n# mod tokio {\n#     pub(super) fn spawn(_: impl std::future::Future) {}\n# }\nasync fn my_async_fn() {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet _parent_span = tracing::info_span!(\"parent\").entered();\n\n// Do this:\ntokio::spawn(\n    my_async_fn().instrument(tracing::debug_span!(\"child\").or_current())\n);\n\n// ...rather than this:\ntokio::spawn(\n    my_async_fn()\n        .instrument(tracing::debug_span!(\"child\"))\n        .in_current_span()\n);\n```\n\n[enabled]: crate::Subscriber::enabled\n[`Subscriber`]:

whether a span or event is [enabled] based on the provided [metadata].\n\n[enabled]: crate::Subscriber::enabled\n[metadata]: crate::Metadata\n\nThis macro is a specialized tool: it is intended to be used prior\nto an expensive computation required *just* for that event, but\n*cannot* be done as part of an argument to that event, such as\nwhen multiple events are emitted (e.g., iterating over a collection\nand emitting an event for each item).\n\n# Usage\n\n[Subscribers] can make filtering decisions based all the data included in a\nspan or event's [`Metadata`]. This means that it is possible for `enabled!`\nto return a _false positive_ (indicating that something would be enabled\nwhen it actually would not be) or a _false negative_ (indicating that\nsomething would be disabled when it would actually be enabled).\n\n[Subscribers]: crate::subscriber::Subscriber\n[`Metadata`]: crate::metadata::Metadata\n\nThis occurs when a subscriber is using a _more specific_ filter than the\nmetadata provided to the `enabled!` macro. Some situations that can result\nin false positives or false negatives include:\n\n- If a subscriber is using a filter which may enable a span or event based\non field names, but `enabled!` is invoked without listing field names,\n`enabled!` may return a false negative if a specific field name would\ncause the subscriber to enable something that would otherwise be disabled.\n- If a subscriber is using a filter which enables or disables specific events by\nfile path and line number,  a particular event may be enabled/disabled\neven if an `enabled!` invocation with the same level, target, and fields\nindicated otherwise.\n- The subscriber can choose to enable _only_ spans or _only_ events, which `enabled`\nwill not reflect.\n\n`enabled!()` requires a [level](crate::Level) argument, an optional `target:`\nargument, and an optional set of field names. If the fields are not provided,\nthey are considered to be unknown. `enabled!` attempts to match the\nsyntax of `event!()` as closely as possible, which can be seen in the\nexamples below.\n\n# Examples\n\nIf the current subscriber is interested in recording `DEBUG`-level spans and\nevents in the current file and module path, this will evaluate to true:\n```rust\nuse tracing::{enabled, Level};\n\nif enabled!(Level::DEBUG) {\n    // some expensive work...\n}\n```\n\nIf the current subscriber is interested in recording spans and events\nin the current file and module path, with the target \"my_crate\", and at the\nlevel  `DEBUG`, this will evaluate to true:\n```rust\n# use tracing::{enabled, Level};\nif enabled!(target: \"my_crate\", Level::DEBUG) {\n    // some expensive work...\n}\n```\n\nIf the current subscriber is interested in recording spans and events\nin the current file and module path, with the target \"my_crate\", at\nthe level `DEBUG`, and with a field named \"hello\", this will evaluate\nto true:\n\n```rust\n# use tracing::{enabled, Level};\nif enabled!(target: \"my_crate\", Level::DEBUG, hello) {\n    // some expensive work...\n}\n```\n\n# Alternatives\n\n`enabled!` queries subscribers with [`Metadata`] where\n[`is_event`] and [`is_span`] both return `false`. Alternatively,\nuse [`event_enabled!`] or [`span_enabled!`] to ensure one of these\nreturns true.\n\n\n[`Metadata`]: crate::Metadata\n[`is_event`]: crate::Metadata::is_event\n[`is_span`]: crate::Metadata::is_span\n[`enabled!`]: crate::enabled\n[`span_enabled!`]: crate::span_enabled","links":{"crate::Subscriber::enabled":"20:684:2455","`event_enabled!`":"0:30:2703","crate::span_enabled":"0:31:2710","crate::subscriber::Subscriber":"20:681:2425","crate::Metadata::is_span":"20:500:4596","crate::metadata::Metadata":"20:477:2432","crate::Level":"20:1000:2431","crate::Metadata::is_event":"20:499:4594","crate::Metadata":"20:477:2432"},"attrs":["#[macro_export]"],"deprecation":null,"inner":{"macro":"macro_rules! enabled {\n    (kind: $kind:expr, target: $target:expr, $lvl:expr, { $($fields:tt)* } ) => { ... };\n    (kind: $kind:expr, target: $target:expr, $lvl:expr ) => { ... };\n    (target: $target:expr, $lvl:expr ) => { ... };\n    (kind: $kind:expr, target: $target:expr, $lvl:expr, $($field:tt)*) => { ... };\n    (target: $target:expr, $lvl:expr, $($field:tt)*) => { ... };\n    (kind: $kind:expr, $lvl:expr, $($field:tt)*) => { ... };\n    (kind: $kind:expr, $lvl:expr) => { ... };\n    ($lvl:expr) => { ... };\n    ($lvl:expr, $($field:tt)*) => { ... };\n}"}},"0:34:574":{"id":"0:34:574","crate_id":0,"name":"debug","span":{"filename":"src/macros.rs","begin":[1580,0],"end":[1831,1]},"visibility":"public","docs":"Constructs an event at the debug level.\n\nThis functions similarly to the [`event!`] macro.
