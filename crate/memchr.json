library provides heavily optimized routines for string search primitives.\n\n# Overview\n\nThis section gives a brief high level overview of what this crate offers.\n\n* The top-level module provides routines for searching for 1, 2 or 3 bytes\n  in the forward or reverse direction. When searching for more than one byte,\n  positions are considered a match if the byte at that position matches any\n  of the bytes.\n* The [`memmem`] sub-module provides forward and reverse substring search\n  routines.\n\nIn all such cases, routines operate on `&[u8]` without regard to encoding. This\nis exactly what you want when searching either UTF-8 or arbitrary bytes.\n\n# Example: using `memchr`\n\nThis example shows how to use `memchr` to find the first occurrence of `z` in\na haystack:\n\n```\nuse memchr::memchr;\n\nlet haystack = b\"foo bar baz quuz\";\nassert_eq!(Some(10), memchr(b'z', haystack));\n```\n\n# Example: matching one of three possible bytes\n\nThis examples shows how to use `memrchr3` to find occurrences of `a`, `b` or\n`c`, starting at the end of the haystack.\n\n```\nuse memchr::memchr3_iter;\n\nlet haystack = b\"xyzaxyzbxyzc\";\n\nlet mut it = memchr3_iter(b'a', b'b', b'c', haystack).rev();\nassert_eq!(Some(11), it.next());\nassert_eq!(Some(7), it.next());\nassert_eq!(Some(3), it.next());\nassert_eq!(None, it.next());\n```\n\n# Example: iterating over substring matches\n\nThis example shows how to use the [`memmem`] sub-module to find occurrences of\na substring in a haystack.\n\n```\nuse memchr::memmem;\n\nlet haystack = b\"foo bar foo baz foo\";\n\nlet mut it = memmem::find_iter(haystack, \"foo\");\nassert_eq!(Some(0), it.next());\nassert_eq!(Some(8), it.next());\nassert_eq!(Some(16), it.next());\nassert_eq!(None, it.next());\n```\n\n# Example: repeating a search for the same needle\n\nIt may be possible for the overhead of constructing a substring searcher to be\nmeasurable in some workloads. In cases where the same needle is used to search\nmany haystacks, it is possible to do construction once and thus to avoid it for\nsubsequent searches. This can be done with a [`memmem::Finder`]:\n\n```\nuse memchr::memmem;\n\nlet finder = memmem::Finder::new(\"foo\");\n\nassert_eq!(Some(4), finder.find(b\"baz foo quux\"));\nassert_eq!(None, finder.find(b\"quux baz bar\"));\n```\n\n# Why use this crate?\n\nAt first glance, the APIs provided by this crate might seem weird. Why provide\na dedicated routine like `memchr` for something that could be implemented\nclearly and trivially in one line:\n\n```\nfn memchr(needle: u8, haystack: &[u8]) -> Option<usize> {\n    haystack.iter().position(|&b| b == needle)\n}\n```\n\nOr similarly, why does this crate provide substring search routines when Rust's\ncore library already provides them?\n\n```\nfn search(haystack: &str, needle: &str) -> Option<usize> {\n    haystack.find(needle)\n}\n```\n\nThe primary reason for both of them to exist is performance. When it comes to\nperformance, at a high level at least, there are two primary ways to look at\nit:\n\n* **Throughput**: For this, think about it as, \"given some very large haystack\n  and a byte that never occurs in that haystack, how long does it take to\n  search through it and determine that it, in fact, does not occur?\"\n* **Latency**: For this, think about it as, \"given a tiny haystack---just a\n  few bytes---how long does it take to determine if a byte is in it?\"\n\nThe `memchr` routine in this crate has _slightly_ worse latency than the\nsolution presented above, however, its throughput can easily be over an\norder of magnitude faster. This is a good general purpose trade off to make.\nYou rarely lose, but often gain big.\n\n**NOTE:** The name `memchr` comes from the corresponding routine in libc. A key\nadvantage of using this library is that its performance is not tied to its\nquality of implementation in the libc you happen to be using, which can vary\ngreatly from platform to platform.\n\nBut what about substring search? This one is a bit more complicated. The\nprimary reason for its existence is still indeed performance, but it's also\nuseful because Rust's core library doesn't actually expose any substring\nsearch routine on arbitrary bytes. The only substring search routine that\nexists works exclusively on valid UTF-8.\n\nSo if you have valid UTF-8, is there a reason to use this over the standard\nlibrary substring search routine? Yes. This routine is faster on almost every\nmetric, including latency. The natural question then, is why isn't this\nimplementation in the standard library, even if only for searching on UTF-8?\nThe reason is that the implementation details for using SIMD in the standard\nlibrary haven't quite been worked out yet.\n\n**NOTE:** Currently, only `x86_64` targets have highly accelerated\nimplementations of substring search. For `memchr`, all targets have\nsomewhat-accelerated implementations, while only `x86_64` targets have highly\naccelerated implementations. This limitation is expected to be lifted once the\nstandard library exposes a platform independent SIMD API.\n\n# Crate features\n\n* **std** - When enabled (the default), this will permit this crate to use\n  features specific to the standard library. Currently, the only thing used\n  from the standard library is runtime SIMD CPU feature detection. This means\n  that this feature must be enabled to get AVX accelerated routines. When\n  `std` is not enabled, this crate will still attempt to use SSE2 accelerated\n  routines on `x86_64`.\n* **libc** - When enabled (**not** the default), this library will use your\n  platform's libc implementation of `memchr` (and `memrchr` on Linux). This\n  can be useful on non-`x86_64` targets where the fallback implementation in\n  this crate is not as good as the one found in your libc. All other routines\n  (e.g., `memchr[23]` and substring search) unconditionally use the\n  implementation in this crate.","links":{"`memmem`":"0:300","`memmem::Finder`":"0:984"},"attrs":["#![deny(missing_docs)]"],"deprecation":null,"kind":"module","inner":{"is_crate":true,"items":["0:300","0:288","0:290","0:283","0:292","0:284","0:282","0:294","0:296","0:286","0:298","0:287","0:285","0:137","0:153","0:170"]}},"2:7829":{"id":"2:7829","crate_id":2,"name":"Iterator","span":null,"visibility":"public","docs":null,"links":{},"attrs":[],"deprecation":null,"kind":"trait","inner":{"is_auto":false,"is_unsafe":false,"items":["2:7830","2:7831","2:7832","2:7833","2:7835","2:7838","2:7839","2:7840","2:7841","2:7843","2:7845","2:7846","2:7848","2:7851","2:7858","2:7860","2:7863","2:7864","2:7865","2:7867","2:7869","2:7872","2:7873","2:7874","2:7878","2:7881","2:7882","2:7883","2:7885","2:7886","2:7888","2:7898","2:7913","2:7915","2:7919","2:7928","2:7931","2:7933","2:7936","2:7943","2:7950","2:7957","2:7966","2:7976","2:7983","2:7990","2:7991","2:7992","2:8004","2:8011","2:8023","2:8030","2:8031","2:8036","2:8039","2:8042","2:8043","2:8045","2:8047","2:8050","2:8053","2:8056","2:8059","2:8062","2:8065","2:8067","2:8069","2:8071","2:8073","2:8075","2:8076","2:8084"],"generics":{"params":[],"where_predicates":[]},"bounds":[],"implementors":[]}},"0:974":{"id":"0:974","crate_id":0,"name":"FindRevIter","span":{"filename":"src/memmem/mod.rs","begin":[356,0],"end":[362,1]},"visibility":"public","docs":"An

controls whether heuristics are used to accelerate searching.\n\nA prefilter refers to the idea of detecting candidate matches very quickly,\nand then confirming whether those candidates are full matches. This\nidea can be quite effective since it's often the case that looking for\ncandidates can be a lot faster than running a complete substring search\nover the entire input. Namely, looking for candidates can be done with\nextremely fast vectorized code.\n\nThe downside of a prefilter is that it assumes false positives (which are\ncandidates generated by a prefilter that aren't matches) are somewhat rare\nrelative to the frequency of full matches. That is, if a lot of false\npositives are generated, then it's possible for search time to be worse\nthan if the prefilter wasn't enabled in the first place.\n\nAnother downside of a prefilter is that it can result in highly variable\nperformance, where some cases are extraordinarily fast and others aren't.\nTypically, variable performance isn't a problem, but it may be for your use\ncase.\n\nThe use of prefilters in this implementation does use a heuristic to detect\nwhen a prefilter might not be carrying its weight, and will dynamically\ndisable its use.
